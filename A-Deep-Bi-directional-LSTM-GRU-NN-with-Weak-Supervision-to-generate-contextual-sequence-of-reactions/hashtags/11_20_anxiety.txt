In this article, I want to discuss depression, something very personal to me and my frightening black dog. And I want to explain a little about how depression can be talked about without the "black dog" metaphor.

Holding onto anxious thoughts can make you feel like you‚Äôre walking around with extra weight on your shoulders. Here are some in-the-moment tips to help you let go.#anxiety #wellbeing

It's mission critical to get hybrid work right. Our executives discuss Cisco's end-to-end, inclusive, and highly secure approach to hybrid work at Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo.
-----------------------------
I find it difficult to relax, to take off from work, to not think about what I need to get done.And the constant rumination of what is ahead of me, or behind me, adds to the sense of stress I carry. The weight of these pressures tires me out and make me question if I can manage it all.Why do I not just ease up, take a break, and not take life so seriously?It may seem like I should be able to simply stop, breathe, and suddenly become one of the walking well.Much of my response to situations and circumstances are rooted in the mental illness that I live with, a complex form of PTSD, with heightened anxiety and waves of mild to deeper depressions. Work is my way of distracting from the feelings underlying the depression, my coping mechanism.And, as with many other mental illnesses we face in life, the source is rooted in my childhood. My parents both faced challenges when they were children and they turned to an almost frantic pace of work to stay clear of the anxiety that followed them. This was a time when mental illness was referred to as craziness and people were sent away to ‚Äòrest.‚Äô For them, it made sense to keep moving and work long hours to stay away from what might be there.They wanted to instill the same work ethic in me, and in their minds to save me from anxiety and depression. Many times, I heard to not sit around doing nothing, to not mope about rather than keeping busy, and idle time is wasting what you could be doing for others. I heard regularly about how tough other people‚Äôs lives were and that I should appreciate every minute I had to work and contribute. How could I relax? If I do not work all the time, I will be a disappointment to my parents. And dealing with the guilt of that disappointment is overwhelming. That is what keeps me working long hours and not allowing myself to relax. It does not help that I love my work, I gain so much meaning from what I do. But too much of anything is not responsible, it is actually a lack of discipline. I need to relax and take time to renew to be at my best ‚Äì it takes self-control to put aside time regularly to breathe.The beliefs we learn as children are deeply embedded in us. Sometimes we do not even know they are there. And by trying to please my parents, clocking heavy work weeks, I have ended up in a place they so wanted to save me from ‚Äì living with mental illness. I am changing my relationship with work, to be healthier. It is not a distraction from my feelings, it is a rewarding part of my life. And taking time to relax and unwind is a needed piece of being able to contribute at my best. I love my mind, and all the complexities of it, and I need to give it the room needed to be alive and full of energy, not weighed down with worry.I hope this message connects with some of you, to give yourself room to relax, and enjoy the work you do, not turning it into a pressing need to meet some inner critic.Take care and be kind to each other.#mentalhealth #anxiety

Are you aware of the subtle ways to be kind to those in your teams who experience anxiety?.Came across this today, and it is such a good idea, that would have an untold positive impact for people who experience anxiety in the workplace.It is a very small thing to do and just as easy.  I know myself I have on occasions gone to meetings with superiors and said a silent ‚Äúphew‚Äù to myself when I discovered the meeting was going to be a positive one.I am going to incorporate this at work, if you manage teams you could try this as well.#anxiety #mentalhealthmatters #work #compassionateleadership #leadership #whatinspiresme #care

Teens in Distress? Attention!Is your student or child not studying? Has his /her behavior changed drastically? Is he/she not participating in sports activities?Attention Mentors and Parents!‚ÄúDepression doesn‚Äôt see gender, age, race, or culture. Mild or chronic, teen depression is critical. Support from family and professional care will help them brave the silent enemy known as Depression,‚Äù says Ms. Gaganjot Gill - PGT, MRIS MOHALI.According to her, ‚Äúgrowing children need our guidance at every step, even though they may think they don‚Äôt.

When you think of the holidays, what comes up?   Is it delight because you get to see loved ones?  Excitement as you look forward to favorite traditions?  The magic of the season?  Or does anxiety kick in?   Fears of unmet expectations?  The weight of having to show up a certain way for others?   The responsibility for making celebrations happen even though you‚Äôre already overworked and exhausted.   Or even feeling lonely - Whether you‚Äôre actually alone or in a house with lots of other people?  You are allowed to feel whatever you feel.   No matter how heavy.   This time of year, I always have to give my expectations an adjustment so I can keep my anxiety in check and enjoy the holidays without disappointment or resentment.

How to empty your head of negative or troubling thoughts ‚Ä¶Everyone has thoughts that can sometimes continually roll around in their head, and which they cannot control, nor stop thinking about. People have different ways for working though these, here are 2 approaches that I find really effective:1. Talk to someone.¬†This is something I probably value the most in my friends. They listen, support, empathise, are open minded, and provide good advice.It's a good way to receive honest feedback, and a different perspective, which sometimes just helps you see things much more clearly and in an objective way. They may also have had similar experiences, so understanding how they dealt with the situation can be helpful. 2. Write your thoughts down ‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt even need to read them back.One of the most effective ways to process or understand your thoughts can be to write them down. Pennebaker's rules is a good technique.¬†It involves writing down your thoughts, for yourself only: let your thoughts flow, you don‚Äôt even need to read them back afterwards, you can throw them away.You do this for a minimum of 4 days continuously, 15 minutes or so. Sometimes it can take longer depending on what the thought it, and you may end up writing the same thing over and over.But, a few days later, you will feel slightly different ‚Ä¶ your thoughts will make more sense, and will be more organised. This technique is known to reduce stress and anxiety for some.Food for thought.Everyone is different, other things may work for you. Some people find walking ‚Äòclears one's head‚Äô, exercise works for others, as does meditation.How about you, what works for you?#people #writing #anxiety #stress

Just because you can do it doesn't mean you should be doing it!This has been a difficult distinction for me over the years to agree on and I still have moments of that voice in my head saying don't spend money outsourcing when I can learn and do what's needed,  whether it's bookkeeping, marketing, I.T support, HR, I've did all these on my own for years in my business manager position and our Practice grew slowly at first as I learned and developed all the many hats until I hit burnout.  I was done, no good to anyone, still trying to manage the business on my sick bed as I had my phone stuck to me 24/7.Then I finally admitted I needed help, and gradually those many hats I wore got given to either new staff or outsourced and the business grew further and my skills developed further still but sensibly to what I could take on that actually benefited both myself and the business.I agree with that whispering voice, like  I can do a lot of what marketers do and I could save a lot of money in  their agency fees for our Ortho Practice, but I also have a million other tasks that only I can do in my role. So, I let go of those thoughts and  outsource a lot more now to protect my time being hijacked and oversubscribed.If you did everyone's job just because you could, firstly I'd question the quality and consistency of the results you'd achieve and secondly I'd be concerned about your risks of burnout as you add more and more pressure to your already busy day. Burnout isn't one event; it's sneaky and gradual over a long time.Now, depending on your stage of growth in your business, you may have to do more tasks if cashflow is tight; however, there is a lot you can do with optimising your personal and business productivity such as automation, delegation and deletion.More productivity tips to come soon, so stay tuned üòâ Have a great day #beingproductive #coaching #businessgrowth #coaching #burnout #anxiety

Happy Thanksgiving everyone!  I have so much to be thankful for.  Almost 20 years ago, I had a dream...and I just realized it came true with the help of this sign from Jersey Signs & Vehicle Graphics It was a dream I told very few about - not even some family - but kept very close to my heart; a one stop place of health.  Not just of the body, but of the mind and spirit as well.  At the time, I thought it was just that - a dream. Something to strive for.  And now, its happened a little differently than I envisioned it, but it's happened nonetheless. The only thing missing is a fitness center.  Oh wait, we're literally LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES FROM ONE.Don't lose sight of your dreams, and they will never fail you. ‚òï Isn't it time you became the most authentic version of you?

What makes you anxious?All to often the cause is simpler than it appears. Your body reacts to lack of sleep, food, fresh air and social interaction as a sign of crisis. Your body then responds to this by placing you on high alert. #Anxiety! Unfortunately when this #anxiety  kicks in your mind often looks for a more complex reason for the anxiety, and begins #overthinking. Sometimes it‚Äôs worth trying to reframe your overthinking as just a sign of the unmet need. Prioritise, sleep, food, fresh air and connections for 24 hours.  #sleep #connections #personaldevelopment

Will you sleep tonight? üí§  Try this?Research has shown that often people have the worst nights sleep on a Sunday night.Why?Because many of us of switch on to our work issues on Sunday evening.It is on our minds when we go to bed, we don‚Äôt sleep well as we begin to fire up for Monday.The result being that we begin our Monday feeling tired and sometimes stressed.What can you do about this?Science tells us that using a ‚Äòbreath‚Äô technique will help you relax and get to sleep so that you wake up feeling refreshed and calm.Many of my clients suffer from a lack of sleep. I suggest ¬†this exercise : when you are lying down take three or five deep breaths in and then when you breath out take 5 deep breaths out or seven breaths out! ¬†You must have longer out breaths. Keep going for a short while. You will start to feel sleepy. ¬†It works to calm the parasympathetic nerve helping us to relax and sleep deeply .I frequently do this as I‚Äôm a very excitable type of person, and need to calm myself before I go to sleep.Give it go! If you need further help to calm that busy head, and learn some techniques to manage your mind.Get in touch ‚Äì Sleep well#stressmanagement #sleep #anxiety #tired #stressrelief

S.A.D - Seasonal Affective Disorder; Changes in seasons (including environment, weather and time) can effect our Mental Health, causing depression and other symptoms that can lead to serious concerns. S.A.D typically begins to effect those with a higher chance of the disorder around the same times every year. You may find symptoms starting in the fall, usually around seasonal time changes and continue into the winter months, draining your emotions, energy and physical state. Often becoming easily agitated, and less interested in daily activities.Depending on severity and other Mental Illnesses treatments for S.A.D may involve light therapy, psychotherapy and medications to treat symptoms. You are not alone in your 'Winter Blues' battles. Take them serious, take the proper steps to taking care of yourself, regulating your Thoughts, Behaviors and Emotions throughout the tougher, darker months and year.

- Lack of support structures and guidelines‚Å†- Structural under-resourcing‚Å†- Adherence to outdated modes of working‚Å†- Values mismatch‚Å†‚Å†When I read this I hit every single on of these aspects in my jobs over the last 10 years. And each and every time they are the reasons I left a job. ‚Å†‚Å†I didn't realise however, that going from job to job I wasn't really learning my lessons. ‚Å†‚Å†- I didn't learn how to set boundaries‚Å†- I didn't learn how to speak up when I wasn't ok ‚Å†- I felt like I had to just do it all and get it done whilst drowning. ‚Å†- I allowed myself to be mistreated, underpaid and overworked.‚Å†- I also realised I wasn't really aligned with this line of work. ‚Å†‚Å†Which brought me here. ‚Å†‚Å†I was meant for more! ‚Å†‚Å†I was meant for something else. ‚Å†‚Å†I was meant to help others in a significant way. ‚Å†‚Å†How did I get here?‚Å†‚Å†I started my own personal development journey.

Last month on Thriving in Diversity myself  Steven Dayan Doris Day, MD  Dr Evan Rieder and Dr. Katherine Phillips tackled the pervasive Body Dysmorphia Disorder (BDD). ü™ûWe discussed a study that were retrospectively reviewed for psychiatric conditions in the Dermatology setting.There were 1,000 patients from a cosmetic dermatology clinic and 1,000 patients from a medical dermatology clinic, both at MGH. The researchers found that 49% of patients in the cosmetic group had been diagnosed with at least one psychiatric disorder, compared with 33% in the medical group (P¬†< .00001).The most most common psychiatric disorders were anxiety,¬†depression,¬†ADHD, and¬†insomnia. üß†39% of patients in the cosmetic group had 2 or more psychiatric disorders, compared with 22 of those in the medical group.44% of patients in the cosmetic group were on a psychiatric medications, compared with 28% in the medical group (P¬†< .00001). ¬†¬†It‚Äôs important to note that studies have found the incident of patients with BDD in the Dermatology setting to be as high as 13%. These studies are an important  into further elucidating our cosmetic patient population's¬†motivations for care and¬†effectively guiding our patients through consultation and treatment to ensure realistic expectations. üôèGo to https://lnkd.in/gkHrNHg5 to catch the last episode of thriving in case you missed it and as always let me know what you think below. ‚ú®#anxiety #depression #adhd #insomnia #bodydysmorphiadisorder #lovetheskinyouarein #bdd #mentalhealthawareness #aestheticdermatology

Another point about imposter syndrome. It‚Äôs a rabbid beast that is driven by perfectionism. Perfectionism is something that is taught by way of behaviour modification principles at uni. (Well in law it is!) - no mistakes. Mistakes = lost marks - short sentences! - AGLC4 ü´£- the idea that only students who achieve a HD status belong in law because in law, we can not make mistakes! Then we wonder why junior associates are: - afraid to speak when they have an opinion- feel anxious typing up a document - check the spelling and grammar on their emails 10x before sending it. - suffer from stress and anxiety due to perceived pressures Perfectionism creates imposter syndrome and imposter syndrome is silencing and holds you back from growth within your profession and as a human being. Humans make mistakes. Mistakes are how we learn. #impostersyndrome #anxiety #lawstudentlife #lawstudent

High expectations and high assumptions lead us towards anxiety, worry and apprehension! Do your best! Give your best! Hope for the best! Be an optimistic! Have patience! Wait for opportunity! Time plays a key role! It has its value! Believe! Belief gives everything! It helps us to inspire and encourage to move forward with great zeal of enthusiasm in order to fetch the fruitful results in reality. It also makes us to determine and dedicate to focus more on our desired goals to reach our destination safely and securely well in time. Burning desire keeps us to learn more and more thru various means and improves our skill development thru applying technology gives accurate and efficient results. Plan well and implement it in an effective and efficient manner in order to get the best results in reality. Effort alone can yield the best results. Your effort is your valuable asset. Effort will never go waste. Set a goal and follow accordingly. Your goal should be specific, measurable, achievable, reliable, and have time bound. Then only we can accomplish it with discipline and positive attitude. Cultivate a positive attitude. It makes us to reach the positive people at the right time with the right cause to acquire the right results.üôè #opportunity #technology #people #development #expectation #assumptions #lead #anxiety #worrying #frustration #stress #patinece #time #wait #postivemindset #positiveattitude #peaceofmind #pleasure #calmness #creativity #effectiveness

3 ways to calm those interview nerves! üò¨Nerves before an interview are normal, and they are a sign of showing how much you want this job. The important thing is to know how to handle those nerves so they don‚Äôt throw you off!üîµ At the start of your interview, ask a question to the person interviewing you to break the ice and give you a second to settle in. Maybe do some research on the person interviewing them, ask them a question about their time at the business.üîµ Try some breathing to calm your anxiety before the interview. There‚Äôs loads of apps out there that will help you with this. It‚Äôs a proven way to slow your heart rate and reduce anxiety.üîµ Convert nervous energy into excited energy. Anxiety and excitement are both aroused emotions, and the physical effect they have on the body is almost identical. In both these emotions, the heart beats faster, cortisol rises, and the body prepares for action. The difference is that excitement is a positive emotion, so try and focus in on that excitement!Our consultants are always here to help you with any interview prep and techniques to help fight those nerves!

I ate a whole box¬†of cookies¬†in about¬†15¬†minutes on Saturday. That was my perfectionism¬†showing up. You may ask me, "What? That doesn't sound like perfectionism!" But it is. Listen to this episode to find out how."Perfectionism is more than pushing yourself to do your best to achieve a goal; it‚Äôs a reflection of an inner self mired in anxiety." That's my guest, Dr. Thomas Greenspon.¬†There's a difference between being stuck in perfectionism¬†and pursuing excellence. A lot of us carry a long held belief that if we aren't perfect, we aren't¬†worth it. That's different than being amazing at your job, or whatever goals you set for yourself!"Perfectionism is simultaneously a desire to be perfect and a fear of imperfection," says Greenspon. If you let go of the anxiety around perfection, you won‚Äôt be less skilled or successful. You will just lose the trailing effect of the anxiety."Wouldn't that be amazing?Listen on Apple podcasts: https://lnkd.in/e3_Fcwj7Listen on Spotify: https://lnkd.in/eKZecxuq#perfectionism #perfectionist #mentalhealth #mentalhealthatwork #workplacementalhealth #anxiety #ambition #success

Why talking about anxiety won‚Äôt always cure itHave you tried talk therapy for anxiety but don‚Äôt feel any better or still struggle with symptoms such as a racing heart or shallow breathing?I want to explain how your nervous system works and why you can still feel anxiety despite your best intentions. The autonomic nervous system is designed to protect you. Part of it is the sympathetic nervous system , a network of nerves that helps your body activate its ‚Äúfight-or-flight‚Äù response.If¬†you sense danger, (real or not) your eyes or ears send information to the amygdala, an area of the brain which contributes to emotional processing.¬† When it perceives danger, it sends a distress signal to the hypothalamus.This part of the brain communicates with the rest of the body through your autonomic nervous system, which controls breathing, blood pressure, heartbeat, and key blood vessels and small airways in the lungs.When you are feeling anxious, this fight or flight system kicks into action, and physical symptoms can appear ‚Äî headaches, nausea, shortness of breath, shakiness, or stomach pain.Hormones like adrenaline are released and if stress is prolonged, a second process starts which releases cortisol, revving up the body to stay alert.All of these physical processes happen so quickly you probably aren't even aware of them.¬†In fact, your brain‚Äôs wiring is so efficient the amygdala and hypothalamus start this cascade even before the brain's visual centers have had a chance to fully process what is happening.Your nervous system scans your inner and outer environment for potential dangers, then adapts what‚Äôs going on your body based on what it finds.It could be an angry partner, a toxic work situation or a place where you don‚Äôt feel accepted that triggers your nervous system.Regulating your nervous system helps manage anxiety, allowing you to move from a fight or flight state into a relaxed one.No matter how resilient you are, if you spend too long in a stressed or anxious state, it becomes harder for your nervous system to bounce back to normal (homeostasis).In my next post, I will detail some practices to regulate your nervous system.If it‚Äôs of value, you might like to listen to these meditations.https://lnkd.in/gG49xdGZ¬† https://lnkd.in/dUkS5gaW ¬†And you can find more resources on mental health here www.sophiescott.com.au¬†and https://lnkd.in/gJxNX4aWhat do you do in your daily life to stay calm and manage stress?Sources: Harvard Medical School, Dr Peter Levine, Tara Brach¬†Take care, Soph x.#highfunctioninganxiety #anxietyhelp #psychology #mentalhealth #stress #burnout #burnoutprevention #burnoutrecovery #selfcaretips #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthawareness #anxiety #anxietytips #anxietysupport #negativethoughts #emotionalhealth #stress #stopthestigma #psychologicalhelp #mindbody #trauma #traumarecovery #work

Sleep is  necessary - It is as  vital to our  physical bodies as  consuming, drinking and breathing,  as well as is vital for  preserving  great  psychological  as well as physical  health and wellness. Sleeping helps us to recover from mental  in addition to physical  effort.

During my early years as a teacher, I could always confide in my lovely Welsh Nanna with my mixed feelings about my chosen profession and how stressed and conflicted I was.I remember one particular day, when I felt I just couldn‚Äôt carry on. I was feeling so frustrated that I hadn‚Äôt found the answer yet. She listened so patiently and really felt my pain. Instead of telling me what I was so used to hearing (life is tough...just roll up your sleeves and get on with it...that‚Äôs what the working world is like, just accept it...only a few lucky people actually like their jobs...the problem is you‚Äôre too sensitive...) she just took my hand, looked me in the eyes and said:‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find your niche, love.‚ÄùJust a few simple words, but they meant so much. With those words I felt heard, validated, supported; even empowered.In that moment, I felt I was given permission to choose. I just had to be patient. I was only 25 at the time; I was still figuring out who I was and what I stood for.¬†Once you know those things, it gets easier to forge your path.¬†Well, Nanna; I did find my niche. I just wish you were here so I could share my journey with you and thank you for believing in me.Diolch nain üíï üòá¬†#teachers #uk #education #school #teacher #teaching #learning #teacherlife #teachersfollowteachers #stress #anxiety #happyfreeteacher

‚ÄúAh I‚Äôve always been a worrier‚ÄùGeneralised anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the list common issues people face and once you hear a bit about it you will recognise elements of this everywhere, but it‚Äôs really not a well known term.For me, it is also often what people are describing with the term ‚Äúhigh functioning anxiety‚Äù as often with GAD the person is very much high functioning. In fact: often very busy, thoughtful, successful, organised, and so busy taking care of everyone and everything to really take space for themselves (which is where it can then cause an issue).This video is my explanation of what generalised anxiety is and how it works.How we treat it is coming up next week!#worry #anxiety #anxietyrelief #mentalhealth #therapy #highfunctioninganxiety

One day, two people met for lunch. One of them, a chiropractor, has been coping with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome for 10 years and the other, a psychologist, has been dealing with the same for 30 years.  From this meeting, 'The Chronic Dialogues' began - shared experiences of hope, hopelessness, chronic pain, bone-sucking fatigue, desperation and searching, acceptance, and learning what to do when there is no instant cure.  We are two health professionals who have dedicated our energy to treating those with chronic illnesses as well as managing them in our own lives. I hope that our conversations bring hope as we explore ideas around our state of mind while searching for cures, emotional ups, and downs, and what helps‚Ä¶.

"From prehistory, through ancient civilizations, and on topresent day societies, emotions have been the cornerstone of all human experiences and actions. Regardless of culture, both painful and pleasant emotions have been the wellsprings of meaning and spirit.However, the 19th century burst of empirical science began quantifying them as data points along with other elements of the natural sciences and largely abandoned their qualitative value. Eventually in the mid to late 20th century, medical science stepped in and re-conceptualized emotions as dysfunctional symptoms of illnesses that stood in the way of productive and efficient human behavior. Thus, the goal became, and continues to be, their elimination through chemical, electrical, and surgical means in order to cure the alleged illnesses.¬†Join us for this year‚Äôs conference when we call for a reversal of this medical conceptualization, recapturing the meaningful and valuable nature of emotions as important guideposts to human living and not mere nuisances or signs of pathology to be eradicated.

Mindfulness works just as well as medication to curb anxiety, study finds...It is really encouraging to see large media outlets like CNN share Mindfulness findings like this one. We all experience anxiety in different ways and we all experience it in some form daily, which is actually very normal.¬† What is not normal is that most of us are unaware that there is choice in those moments of stress. Choice to remain with the anxious thoughts, or choice to redirect our awareness back to the present moment.This article highlights a group of 276 adults with untreated anxiety disorders. Half of the patients were randomly selected to take 10 to 20 mg of escitalopram, the generic form of Lexapro, a common medication used to treat anxiety and depression. The other half were assigned to an eight-week course in mindfulness-based stress reduction.Both groups experienced about a 20% reduction in their anxiety symptoms over the 8 week period.¬† Read the article in full to dig in further as it also breaks down how Mindfulness works.¬†The main benefit of Mindfulness is that it teaches us how to be in the present moment - and with that, unraveling the plethora of life benefits that come with a mindful way of living.¬† Stress reduction and less anxiety can be described as a by-product of this.¬†Start your mindfulness journey today.Thanks Ted Meissner for this great share as always.Guihttps://lnkd.in/eZqHByyZ#mindfulness #mindfulnessresearch #Stress #stressreduction #anxiety #anxietyrelief

Although it won‚Äôt completely get rid of your anxiety, it can be a useful tool to manage it in the moment.The 333 rule is not a substitute for treatment, no matter how helpful it may be to you or how frequently you use it....Presents @mind_serenity_ @mufina_mhp #MIND_SERENITY_ MIND SERENITY Psychological Counseling & Wellbeing Center üòÉ....Have you ever checked on your mental health like body check up ?...Have you booked your counseling sessions for mental health check up?...@mind_serenity_#chennai #tamilpsychologist #tamilnadu #nostresszoneüö´ #positivevibes #psychologist #counseling #giveaway #win #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmatters #worldmentalhealthday #india #love #candles #tiktok #instagram #instagood #reels #usa ...@apapsychiatric @india@thesiddharthnigam @awez_darbar @ayaanzubair_12 @thehappysnapshot @psychologyposts_ @thepsychologymum @psychology__memes @psychology @psychology_mastery @psychology_tamil_ @psychologyfactsin @psychology_info_tamil @drsalihaafridi @psychologyandmore...For mental health counseling and therapy sessions DM us.

"Ultimately, there aren't enough providers to help the sheer amount of people who need help. We need to come up with technological solutions ... we have to come up with ways to help the healthcare industry¬†actually address this."Ernie Wallerstein Jr. is the chief executive officer and co-founder of Mental Health Technologies Inc. (MHT), a cloud-based platform that enables health care clinicians to identify patients that may be suffering from undiagnosed or inadequately treated mental health and substance abuse disorders.¬†¬†"I think every healthcare professional is responsible for the mental wellness of their patients. Mental health is now the number one issue in the world. COVID-19 was bad, but mental health affects way more people than COVID did, and this problem isn't going away. Leveraging a technology like ours helps identify¬†the people who need your time, and helps you treat more efficiently."¬†"Screening for behavioral¬†health and substance abuse should be part of any preventive care philosophy and program."Visit¬†www.mhtech.com¬†to learn more about MHT:https://www.mhtech.com/¬†#sponsored #innovation¬†#healthtech¬†#mentalheallthstartup¬†#mentalhealthcare #healthcarestartup¬†#mentalhealthawareness¬†#podcast¬†#mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness¬†#mentalhealthmatters¬†#mentalhealthsupport #depression¬†#anxiety¬†¬†Bill Leonhard, Paige Pontrelli, Jennifer Salas

Very glad to be able to share the first landmark clinical study that found #mindfulness to be as effective as pharmacological treatment with Lexapro. Both reduce #anxiety by 30%, but mindfulness does it without the side effects and the cost of the drug. Yes, it takes some work‚Ä¶ though not the way most think. As a practitioner of mindfulness for over 37 years, I have benefited from my daily practice. ann flanagan petry Andy Arwari MD MS FACP SFHM FAAHPM HMDC Rafal Szaniawski üá∫üá¶ George Mekeel RN MSCN Jonathan Fisher, MD FACC

Broad, amorphous fears seem huge and unbeatable.But getting concrete cuts them down to size, unfreezing you and readying you to cope.I believe that personal change requires a combination of 'bottom-up' and 'top-down' elements. Think of the latter as essentially mental or intellectual activities, the ones we tend to over-rely on. Because I spent most of my life defaulting to mental activity and over-estimating its effectiveness, I've benefited hugely from incorporating activities that rely more on sensation and intuition - the 'bottom-up' ones.That said, sustainable change takes both, and some mental activities are much more useful than others. Tim Ferriss's "Fear Setting" (https://lnkd.in/e3DDx2kT ) is especially powerful for dealing with forward-projecting worry.It helps us move from vague fretting to:1) Getting specific about just what a Bad future outcome looks like. For instance, moving from 'My new business might fail' to 'I might lose all my income and tarnish my professional reputation.' Further sharpening than this might ensue until you are very concrete.2) Identifying actions you can take to prevent that outcome from happening (or at least reduce its likelihood). To keep from losing all your income, you can possibly keep a part-time gig or try your venture idea during a sabbatical. You may come up with quite a range of these to combine or choose among.3) Listing ways you can recover if the Bad outcome does occur. For example, you can tap into savings, turn to your family for short-term assistance, jump back into the employment market. These are not exactly creative ideas, but let your mind generate a wider set relevant to your situation. Don't shut them down with evaluation and judgment until you've created a big list.So go on. Face it. Define it. De-Mystify it. #fear #anxiety #frozen #blockage

How can we mitigate the spread of "unhealthy ideas"?The application of various learning methods that foster inquiry & critical thinking. Believe it or not, there are many unsafe ways to engage a classroom.Learning comes from a combination of curiosity & challenge; trial & error. Objectives meet performance as our minds acquire information, make meaning of it, and experiment. To make meaning, we need to be able to seek additional information. Risk is introduced when a leader or educator attains ideological power by turning off the free exchange of ideas. They usually have an ulterior motive outside of protecting the group's best interests, and the promotion of groupthink is part of their strategy.Millions of people have found themselves in bad situations on the basis of pursuing a goal while offering unconditional trust along the way. If you don't feel secure in your environment (well-informed, tracking to your own objectives) ask questions. Stay curious about your environment. An ethical leader should never intimidate anyone into ignorance. #people #learning #leadership #environment #power #control #violenceprevention #crisisprevention #security #safety #wellbeing #ideas #education #criticalthinking #inquiry #responsibility #intelligence #knowledge #disinformation #ethics #policy #teachers #instructors #cybersecurity #fraud #childsafety #eldercare #anxiety #socialanxiety #fear #learningdesign #safetybydesign

#Bullying affects millions of lives and can leave us feeling hopeless. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. If we challenge it, we can change it. And it starts by reaching out.Whether it‚Äôs in school, at home, in the community or online, let‚Äôs reach out and show each other the support we need. Reach out to someone you trust if you need to talk. Reach out to someone you know is being bullied. Reach out and consider a new approach.And it doesn‚Äôt stop with young people. We all have a responsibility to help each other reach out. Together, let‚Äôs be the change we want to see. Reflect on our own behaviour, set positive examples and create kinder communities.It takes courage, but it can change lives. So, this Anti-Bullying Week, let‚Äôs come together and reach out to stop bullying.IanDeslowCounselling.co.ukPlease follow me on social media for more posts and updates.#reachout #antibullyingweek #bullying #bekind #kindness #kindnessmatters #wellbeing #antibullying #wellbeingmatters #mentalhealth #Mindshifting #changeisgood #mentalhealthsupport #therapy #counselling #mentalhealthmatters #anxiety #stress #mentalillness #counsellinghelps #counsellingservices #Therapy #counsellor

HUGE BREAKTHROUGH - THIS IS NOT A DRILL!! Cope Notes¬Æ works... and now, we can prove it.For years, we've known that our solution changes lives. We've seen it firsthand, time and time again, across tens of thousands of users.Heck, we even did a qualitative study with USF Health a couple years back that showed - you guessed it - that Cope Notes really does work.But every time we sat down to discuss a large-scale rollout with a Fortune 100 mainstay or an insurance company, one thing always came up in the conversation:"Where's the hard data?"Well, now you don't have to believe me, or even the thousands of people who regularly report improved mental health within 30 days of using Cope Notes.You can just look at these graphs ü§ìüìàWhile the full manuscript awaits its turn in queue for publication (my research friends know how long this can take), I do have permission from USF to share this amazing one-page analysis that says, in short, that...Well, Cope Notes really does work.I don't mean to say "I told ya so," but... ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Thank you to Jennifer T., Katie Torres, and one of my dearest friends Dr. Kristin Kosyluk for facilitating this amazing research and Jennifer Johnston of the Gulf Coast Community Foundation and Daniel Maroney, CRPS¬Æ of Raymond James for taking action and truly championing mental health innovation.For almost 5 years, we've been working towards a breakthrough - the kind of breakthrough that would blast open new doors of opportunity and usher in a whole new era of impact that dwarfs the work we've done to date.This is that breakthrough.Now let's change - and save - some lives.

Healing isn't easy. Healing is complicated. Healing is uncomfortable. It is a long journey that takes a lot of unexpected turns. It takes a lot of time and patience. It takes so much of courage to even think of pulling yourself out of the darkness. It takes you to be really strong both emotionally and mentally. The most difficult thing about healing is that it takes you to face your trauma and fear. In order to get you out of the darkness, it asks you to first get yourself in the darkness. It takes you to feel the hurt and the pain and let it pass through you. It takes you to suffer in order to end the suffering.  It asks you to keep believing that you will get better even when you see no sign of hope. It asks you to keep having faith that you will recover when you've got all the reasons to believe that you won't. Honestly, healing isn't any less painful than the suffering itself. But healing is worth the pain, because on the other side of healing, lies hope, happiness, and a new and better 'you'. https://lnkd.in/du6wPHVD#healing #mentalhealth #healingjourney #mentalhealthrecovery #hopeandhealing #mentalhealthwarrior #depression #anxietyanddepression #anxiety #mentalhealthisimportant #mentalillness #suffering

The pandemic has vastly increased #anxiety and #depression numbers, which is why it is no surprise that #mentalhealth disorders now constitute a national crisis. Studies have reported people have experienced symptoms of major depressive disorder for up to a year after recovering from a coronavirus infection.At OM1, we believe #RealWorldData can help understand the complexities of these diseases and therefore help healthcare stakeholders focus on bringing a dynamic new approach to patient care.

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction vs Escitalopram for the Treatment of Adults With Anxiety Disorders A Randomized Clinical TrialPMID: 36350591https://lnkd.in/dW6Dd22JAs a lifestyle medicine physician, the first tool in my toolbox for many issues is often looking at the individual's habits and mindset and making lifestyle suggestions. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health disorder and affect nearly 301 million people globally.It is fascinating to see randomized controlled trials comparing lifestyle measures with medical therapy. This trial randomized 276 individuals with a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder (generalized anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder, agoraphobia) to a weekly mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) course or escitalopram (Lexapro) 10 or 20 mg for 8 weeks. The participants had outcome measurements at baseline, week 4 (mid-treatment), week 8, and then at follow-up visits at weeks 12 and 24. 208 participants completed the trial. The primary outcome was measuring anxiety levels based on the Clinical Global Impression of Severity scale (CGI-S).They found that the mindfulness group reduced the CGI-S Score by 1.35 (baseline score of 4.44) compared to 1.43 for the escitalopram group (baseline score of 4.51). Both groups continued to improve at follow-up visits. At week 12, the CGI-S scores were 2.89 in the MSBR group and 2.95 in the escitalopram group. At week 24, both groups had a CGI-S score of 2.92. The difference between the groups met the criteria for noninferiority. Another positive of the study was that 10 (8%) of the escitalopram group dropped out due to adverse events, while none of the participants dropped out in the MBSR group. At least one study-related adverse event occurred in 110 (78.6%) of the escitalopram group compared to only 21 (15.4%) of the MSBR.One of the things I strongly advocate is using lifestyle medicine in appropriate individuals before medical therapy and as an augment to medical treatment. Lifestyle medicine physicians consistently see people be able to de-escalate and sometimes altogether remove the necessity to take prescription medications. So I ask you, is your mindset and behavior set fueling or fighting disease?#godfirst #wellness¬†#physician #pharmacist #doctor #holistic¬†#speaker #fitness #medicine #mindset #healthcoach #coaching #health #healthy #lifestyle #stress #anxiety #mindfulness #MBSR #mentalhealth

When last were you able to do nothing without background noise, a phone in your hand or something to keep you distracted? Always needing to be busy, occupied & distracted, keeps you from confronting or facing your thoughts. It also allows you to fuel your worth that you‚Äôve based solely on achievements & external validation. üí≠ Culture plays a huge role in this.

Freedom From Feelings by Feeling ThemWhy do we struggle so much with our feelings?Why do we relentlessly deny our emotions, especially concerning other people?They are only feelings!In a day, we may deny we feel frustrated in reaction to someone selling us a service.We may deny feeling frustrated, angry, or hurt in reaction to a friend.We may deny feelings of fear or anger toward our children.We may deny a range of emotions toward our spouse or the person with whom we're in a love relationship.We may deny feelings provoked by people we work for or those who work for us.Sometimes the feelings are a direct reaction to others.Sometimes people trigger something more profound ‚Äì an old sadness or frustration.Regardless of the source of our feelings, they are still our feelings. We own them.And acceptance is often all that is necessary to make them go away.We don't have to let our feelings control our behaviour. We don't have to act on each feeling that passes through us. We do not need to indulge in inappropriate behaviour.It helps to talk about our feelings with someone we trust.Sometimes we need to bring our emotions to the person triggering them. That can breed intimacy and closeness.But the most important person we need to tell it ourselves.We shall know what to do next if we allow our feelings to pass through us, accept them, and release them.#anxiety #chasingemotions #love #emotionalintelligence #feelings #healing #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawreness #mentalhealthmatters #psychology #poetry #emotionsmatter

üíñ ‚ÄúValue those who give you constructive criticism, because without them doing so, you will never reach the peak of what you are do.‚Äù ‚Äï¬†Unarine Ramaruüíñ No one, no matter who they are, enjoys feeling criticized. It can be difficult to¬†accept criticism. You may feel defensive or even angry when someone has something negative to say about your work. üíñ Whether at work or in relationships, sharing¬†and receiving feedback is part and parcel of improvement.

Anxiety is fear in the absence of obvious danger. It is a human experience that, at times, can be debilitating and overwhelming. The causes of anxiety are very personal, complex, and deep. Our latest article offers a perspective on anxiety, its triggers and sources, and how therapy can help. Please feel free to share this link with anyone who might be interested!#anxiety #therapy #mentalhealth https://lnkd.in/grArh-_c

The first study ever to directly compare medication to meditation for anxiety finds the two methods work equally well at reducing symptoms. The finding, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, suggests that people struggling with anxiety could be helped either by a daily pill or a daily practice of mindfulness.https://lnkd.in/gm7nGiKK#mindfulness #meditation #anxiety #mentalhealth

It will also allow you to expand in any direction you choose. Whether you want to grow financially, professionally, relationally, or spiritually, self-love can help. Without self-love, we look at goals to improve something about ourselves. Because we believe we are lacking, our goal setting revolves around ‚Äúfixing‚Äù or ‚Äúchanging‚Äù. Only once we fix some flaws can we be beautiful, successful, loved, happy, etc. This is why I always start with Self Love.The way I work with each client on goal setting and manifesting the life they dream of isn't typical. Because I work via my intuition, when you and I work together it is going to be different than when I work with your mom, your BFF or your sister. My efforts to help you engineer a life that you can love are unique to you and your core needs as an individual.My toolbox has lots of juicy stuff backed by concepts from emotional intelligence, spiritual intelligence, divination and plain old empathetic intuition and more to help you boost your confidence and engineer an Inpowered & Prosperous Life that you can finally love and look forward to living.It is time to solidify your goals, elevate your Thoughtstyle & be accountable to your purpose and dreams.Not every woman is the same nor should your coaching regimen be.Want to know more?Follow the link in my bio and click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è the Coaching Discovery Call.If you like what you see schedule a üÜìÔ∏è call with me.#selfcare#goals #achieveyourgoals #dontgiveupquotes #atlantalifecoach#psychologist #motivationalquoteoftheday #therapymemes #selfhelper #therapyquotes #positiveqoutes #mentalhealthawarenessmonth #mentalhealthadvocate #unhook #mentalhealblogger #dontjudge #mentalhealthtips #positivity #positivequotestoday #therapistproblems #negativethoughts #anxiety #thinking #mentalhealthadvocate #mindfulness #mentalhealth

100% Emotional Regulation!!Learning to deal with our emotions is never easy.We all need to learn how to feel our feelings.It's important to notice that all emotions are useful. They are neither good  nor bad, rather they are messages.They come to you because they have a purpose. There is nothing more important than to feel our own feelings and then change our relationship with those feelings.So that we can use it to our advantage.  Remember to practice mindfulness. It's important to not hide your emotions but to feel it as it happens.NAME IT TO TAME IT as it happens. Become the observer of your emotions. Emotion is a temporary message, so avoid to create permanence. Meaning, instead of saying I am angry say I have the feeling of anger.Let's see it in a nutshell 1). Notice and name the emotions that you are having.Say,  " I notice that I am feeling Anxious"."I notice I am feeling anger". 2). Notice and name the physical reactions.Say, "I notice I have butterflies in my stomach." " I notice that my palms are sweating üòì.3). Get curious ü§î towards your feelings.Like, I marked my calendar  üìÖ still I missed to attend the session  üôÉ and you feel guilty about it.4). Personify your emotions- Create a persona around your emotions ‚ú®Ô∏è ‚ô•Ô∏è üé∂. Like, Hey Mr Guilty, üëã I notice you are here. Let's have a conversation together. #emotionalwellness #emotionalintelligence #EnlightenedShweta #mindfulnessforkids #emotions #parentingtips #parenthood #children #childhood #mindfulness #Meditation #feelings #anxiety #stress #anger #emotionalregulation  #learning #change #like

"A¬†new study¬†has confirmed what traditional practices like yoga, pranayama, qigong, and meditation have held for thousands of years: that breathing doesn‚Äôt just provide oxygen, but it also¬†affects our emotions, attention, and how we make sense of the world around us. The researchers reviewed both animal and human studies and found that the rhythm of our brains is closely linked to the rhythm of our breath. Difficulty breathing is associated with mood disorders like depression and anxiety. This study sheds light on¬†why practices like yoga and qigong help stabilize mood."¬†#breath #breathe #breathwork #breathing #brain #yoga #pranayama #meditation #mood #emotions #depression #anxiety #mentalhealth

CBT is a form of therapy that deals mostly with your thoughts and how they affect your behaviour. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and behave. It is recommended by the NHS for the treatment of depression or anxiety disorders and can also help people with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder.

ICYMI June 26th, 2020:  Things Educators Said Trauma comes in many forms. I don‚Äôt wish to suggest they are all equal ‚Äî they are not. But this blog post discusses the emotional abuse #teachers intentionally and unintentionally inflict on students.As a teacher, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve said things that upset a student over the last 30 years. We all make mistakes. Those mistakes are not what this post is about, either. You can apologize for mistakes and mean it. I‚Äôve had teachers make mistakes and express sympathy for my response.Some educators are simply cruel. They are bullies. Maybe they don‚Äôt see themselves in that way, but that‚Äôs what they are from the perspective of the outcasts, the students on the margins of the classroom community.The earliest comments I recall were from the time my family lived in Bakersfield, California.A teacher referred to my parents and me as ‚Äútrailer-park trash.‚Äù I cannot recall if we were upgraded to https://is.gd/Ak8RDT #ableism #anxiety #classmates #discrimination

When you begin to think ‚ÄúMy relationship is stressing me out,‚Äù there is the potential for distance, disagreements and disconnection between you and your partner- Dealing with relationship stress is never easy, but it‚Äôs part of life. Even if your partner has consistently been the anchor in your relationship, there will eventually come a time when their tank is running on empty and you will be given the opportunity to provide the love and support that is needed. And while you may find it to be difficult to help your partner during times of stress, generating the mental and emotional resources to help your partner will not only create comfort and connection but a healthy, secure base in the relationship that both partners can consistently count on.- Hectic schedules and everyday work-life demands make it easy to become wrapped up in our own worlds. But when we lose sight of our partner‚Äôs stress, then we are not communicating and we are not connecting. This is why it is imperative to make the extra effort to recognize when you‚Äôre dealing with a stressed partner.- Relationship stress can lead to #mentalhealthproblems like:- #Anxiety when you are around your partner- Over analysis of your interactions- Inability to control your emotions- Feeling depressed or withdrawn- Problems sleepingRelationship stress results in the same negative health effects as any other form of stress:- Stomach issues- Skin problems- Increased risk of heart disease- High blood pressure- Weaker immune systemManagement involves ruling out and managing psychiatric disorders like #OCD or #Depression. Psychological counselling plays a major role in working on personality of partners.https://lnkd.in/dqn6a4Cg

Your worth is not defined by what others think of you. It's defined by the way you think about yourself.It's important to give yourself grace and remember that you cannot please everyone, it's impossible. By doing what is best for your mental and physical health you are improving your overall happiness and level of wellbeing. This is something to be proud of.If you have a tend to be perfectionistic or a people pleaser, you may find it helpful to start small and practice saying no to less important things first, and then work on these skills over time. ...#boundaries #guilt #shame #blame #peoplepleasing #mentalhealth #mentalhealthadvocate #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthsupport #selflove #selflovequotes #selfcare #selfcaretips #selfloveclub #therapy #depression #depressionhelp #anxiety #anxietyawareness #anxietyrelief #anxietyhelp #anxietyrecovery #apartmenttherapy #trauma #traumahealing #traumainformed #telehealthcare #psychologytoday #californiatherapy

This passage is from the #Dhammapada and offers an insight on how we may best learn to walk the Noble Path.Self discovery is an important outcome from noble endeavors. Noble endeavors are the teachers while we are continually the student. After many lessons learned, mindful self-reflection and contemplation, we may begin to open ourselves, and our hearts, to what our life's work may entail. And once this realization has presented itself we gently surrender to it.For more Dharma centered, reflective, and positive posts, please feel free to follow us on Facebook and Instagram @bluelotuscenterBlue Lotus Meditation and Mindfulness Center is a registered 501(c)(3) religious organization.Website and monthly newsletter: www.bluelotusmeditation.usFor guided meditations, Dharma talks, and much more please visit and subscribe to our YouTube channel at: http://bit.lyBlueLotusMeditationFacebook: https://lnkd.in/d63x-4GBInstagram: https://lnkd.in/dhGESSGFBlog: https://lnkd.in/d9s_fG5J#Meditation #Mindful #GuidedMeditation #Mindfulness #Positivity #MentalHealth #PersonalGrowth #Kindness #Lovingkindness #Calm #Compassion #Wellbeing #Gratitude #Anxiety #MindfulMeditation #HealthyRelationships #Veterans #Teens #UnhealthyRelationships #Resiliency #LGBQT #traumahealing #angermanagment #Dharma #DharmaTalk #Sangha #Buddha #Buddhism

This is YOUR time: doctors! For years I've been watching, observing, thinking -- wondering... about those who dedicate their lives to others. Medical personnel - they give, give, give. The Hippocratic Oath has them - as you - go above and beyond. I have always been inspired by your dedication, how you take care of others, how you make patients and their family members feel comfortable even in the darkest of hours. Then I watched you neglect your own health.  I see many of you not taking care of your own bodies, your own minds, your own life.  So dedicated to others.  And today I want to ask you: "Who takes care of you"today I want to ask you:  "If you don't take care of you -- how can you take care of us?"So, today, I ask you to STOP and realize how important you are. This is YOUR time to STOP and take charge of your LIFE outside the office.  ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ÄçLet's face it -- because I witness it and work with you: ~ You are exhausted and stressed ~ You are worried about your most precious relationships~ You are not sure who you are outside the officeIs it not TIME for you to take charge of your LIFE * so you can BE there? * So you can BE with your loved ones? * So you can still care for us?

https://lnkd.in/eDahASnp As the tension mounts and another eviction  tonight...who do you think will be crowned King or Queen of the Jungle?  An important attribute of our obsession with celebrities and artistes is that we value entertainment and novelty. We are motivated to get outside ourselves and to be immersed in something  that's stimulating to our species. To be saturated in newness and interesting individual differences  and personality characteristics contributes to our quality of life and wellbeing balance or so its argued.  There is a degree of novelty in observing the campmates  interact  with each other even in self disclosure about their human side s seen first in Matt Hancock and later in all campmates.  We are attracted to physical beauty  and also to argument and controversy. Heated exchanges between George and Matt is one example  but  reveals much more about how we interpret one another's core traits   attitudes and diversity. Spectacular viewing was Scarlett's quizzing George about his prison sentence and his admittance of his wrongful behaviour. Similarly Matt also confessed with the campmates about his love affair with his aide when questioned by  journalist Charlene..Perhaps this can be attributable to the motive to demonstrate authenticity of the self.  Still a week to go as  campmates  power motives surface on high octane power to impress. viewers. Who can spot the king or Queen of the Jungle?#itv #imacelebrity #anxiety #winnersmindset #jillscott #suecleaver #matthancock #chrismoyle #boygeorge #owenwarner #babatunda #scarlettedouglas #miketindall #journorequests #producers #itv #lorraine #gbnews #bbcnews #theoneshow #heart #talktv #abc #rte #latelateshow #thsun #dailymirror #dailymail #roygreenshow

The #Science Of #Gratitude - a free workshop and practice. "¬†In many #cultures throughout history gratitude was considered the key to good fortune and a #meaningful life. Scientific #research suggests that gratitude leads to #happiness, better #health, closer #relationships, a sense of #connection, more #energy, #self-confidence, and more #positive #emotions, as well as #reducing #stress, #anxiety, and #depression. Cultivating gratitude is an important way to build #physical and #mental #health. After this workshop, you will have an understanding of how gratitude impacts the body and why we need gratitude given how our #brains evolved. We will also take a look at ideas about gratitude from different #ancient #traditions and try several gratitude #meditations together (including self-appreciation). This will be a way of coming together and preparing for Thanksgiving together. We hope to see you there."

If you or someone you know needs more restful sleep, please take a listen to my new Dream Meditation and Visualization at the link below.This dream meditation and visualization offers the meditator a ‚Äúvisioning‚Äù experience, to allow greater fluidity into the dream state. It first helps to free the body of holding patterns, mindfully bringing focus into the present moment, then allows the meditator to let go of any disturbances before visioning begins. Listeners will experience a relaxed rhythm and see the blossoming of what they would like to create before them. A mantra meditation encourages ‚Äúcreativity within stillness.‚Äùhttps://lnkd.in/eTDYgzQt#sleep #meditation #meditationpractice #sleepmeditation #dreams #dreamstate #luciddreams #mindfulness #anxiety #stress #stressrelief #insomnia #visualizationPhoto credit: Johannes Plenio

Did you know that your brains üß†job is to keep you safe and alive. But the most overlooked fact is that your brain isn‚Äôt wired to make you happy. The main purpose of your brain is to keep you safe and make sure you survive. Your body, and particularly your brain, don‚Äôt care whether you‚Äôre happy.üëâÔ∏èIt also doesn't care if what you say is right or wrong, true or false,  so make sure you tell it positive things.  When people sit in anxiety, fear, trauma, the way or brain is wired, it actually thinks it's doing a great job at keeping you alive, because you didn't die yesterday from anxiety, so it gives you more of it.  It is simply your brain mis reading what is going on.  So, tell yourself a better lie!#margariatpolitistransforminglives #roar #realorganicauthenticresults #recoverrebootrefuel #depression #psychology #science #anxiety #awareness #stress #mind #brainhealth #fatigue

Many people are living in the past relying on old memories to create their reality when in fact it is not real at all.¬†This prevents them from living in the present, or even better, creating a new compelling future for themselves.¬†So take a moment to really think about this question because it may sound simple enough, yet so many people get stuck on it. The reason is because they continue to look back rather than look ahead.¬†So.....If you had no worries, fears or concerns, what is it that you really want?There is a world of possibility out there waiting for you.

Life is full of detours. Even the best plans sometimes come to nothing. But does that mean you should stop trying? Of course not!When you‚Äôre diagnosed with a chronic illness, it can feel like one of the biggest detours you‚Äôve ever been on. Suddenly, you‚Äôre being redirected down roads you never knew existed. And at times, it‚Äôs terrifying.A nurse called to tell me I had gastroparesis. Yet another box on my chronic illness bingo card received its dab.The nurse told me I could never again eat fresh fruits and vegetables, meat, or nuts. The news was crushing.It was an unexpected detour, but one that led to dozens of new recipes. I learned what I could eat and when it was safe. The way I ate changed to a slower, more deliberate process. Now, I savor each bite, chewing longer to grind up every morsel.Despite what the nurse told me, it wasn‚Äôt the end of my journey.Detours can be wonderful. When you‚Äôre forced to drive down a road you‚Äôve never been on before, you‚Äôll often see amazing sights. Maybe you‚Äôll find a beautiful old building hidden in a forgotten area of your town or glimpse a sunset in a breathtakingly unique setting.These are only road detours. Detours in life can be just as beautiful.You never know what you can do until you face a situation where you have to do it. I never imagined I could work full time with both mental illness and chronic illness, but yet I do it every day. My detours taught me what I can do.For today, think about the detours you‚Äôve taken.

This passage is from the #Dhammapada and offers an insight on how we may best learn to walk the Noble Path.Self discovery is an important outcome from noble endeavors. Noble endeavors are the teachers while we are continually the student. After many lessons learned, mindful self-reflection and contemplation, we may begin to open ourselves, and our hearts, to what our life's work may entail. And once this realization has presented itself we gently surrender to it.For more Dharma centered, reflective, and positive posts, please feel free to follow us on Facebook and Instagram @bluelotuscenterBlue Lotus Meditation and Mindfulness Center is a registered 501(c)(3) religious organization.Website and monthly newsletter: www.bluelotusmeditation.usFor guided meditations, Dharma talks, and much more please visit and subscribe to our YouTube channel at: http://bit.lyBlueLotusMeditationFacebook: https://lnkd.in/d8fpFG_uInstagram: https://lnkd.in/ddUaszDYBlog: https://lnkd.in/dKjmT-Zu#Meditation #Mindful #GuidedMeditation #Mindfulness #Positivity #MentalHealth #PersonalGrowth #Kindness #Lovingkindness #Calm #Compassion #Wellbeing #Gratitude #Anxiety #MindfulMeditation #HealthyRelationships #Veterans #Teens #UnhealthyRelationships #Resiliency #LGBQT #traumahealing #angermanagment #Dharma #DharmaTalk #Sangha #Buddha #Buddhism
