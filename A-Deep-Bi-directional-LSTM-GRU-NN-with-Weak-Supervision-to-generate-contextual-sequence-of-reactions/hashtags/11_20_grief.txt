On Trans day of remembrance, a day when we center our siblings that we‚Äôve lost. The grief and the mourning continue as we hear of the attack in Colorado Springs at a place where we commune, dance and live freely for a moment. 5 dead and many injured on top of 32 trans lives that were stolen from us this year. In the next hours, we will know their names. Their families and friends will talk about how their lives were interrupted‚Ä¶that which shouldn‚Äôt have. This shouldn‚Äôt have been if we were respected.This shouldn‚Äôt have been if our humanity was acknowledged.This shouldn‚Äôt have been if we were included. This shouldn‚Äôt have been if our lives were deemed worthy of breath.. of existence‚Ä¶ of dignity. This shouldn‚Äôt have been‚Ä¶Killing us will not make you morally superior or more significant. And the really sad part is that the only way you feel significant is through our death/oppression. Nothing else. Whose life do you really perceive to be unworthy?

It was two years on Thursday since we lost our beloved father‚Ä¶ When you lose the foundations of your family, no matter how much time passes, the void can never be filled. Grief is an interesting journey.. you can‚Äôt really overcome grief but you learn to navigate around the feelings of this ‚Äúempty vessel‚Äù. The world around you seems to carry on and you have to learn to fly along with it. Be kind to yourself through these journeys, as you will never know when the tide will come in and out, sometimes even hit you at full speed with no control.. let your tears flow and ensure you have a strong support system and if you don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm always here to talk :) Dad, I know you are watching and your legacy remains in us. I hope we can make you proud and fulfil your ambitions for us. Love you dad forever üíõ #love #grief #mentalhealth #griefawareness

‚ÄúGrief is in two parts. The first is loss. The second is the remaking of life.‚Äù -Anne RoipheThe loss is life-altering. You‚Äôre required to change. Because things will never be the same. They can‚Äôt be.And the sometimes cruel, sometimes kind reminder that impermanence is the one thing we can be sure of. There's no navigating grief right. There‚Äôs no coming out of this unscathed. There are ways to weather it that won‚Äôt leave you worse off. Ways plural. There‚Äôs a comfort in that.  Knowing that there are so many ways to work through this. And at the core of all them is not running away from the truth of the emotion. The remaking of life is a strange feeling at first.It‚Äôs a new concept. One that can feel overwhelming because the details are blurry on how you even got here.There‚Äôs a guilt that bubbles up.Is it okay to move on? What‚Äôs your life look like in the absence of a person, relationship, job, or vision? Just like the first part of the grieving process, you have to try different things. And assess along the way. I help my clients feel the loss in a safe container so that they can begin remaking their life. If you want support in your grief journey, let‚Äôs chat.

I lost a friend this weekTo be frank I haven't had the time to stop and process it We often think we have time but time is its own keeper and we simply exit in it but often do not challenge it to bend it in our favor. She was in a fatal car crash coming home from a work trip and is leaving behind a spouse and 3 kiddosEmbrace the pause the moments to hug a little tighter to tuck them in to listen to reach out to write that cardWe are all given a gift and the time that we have to use the gift is unknown to us.

Thoughts on GriefGrief knows no limits. Knows no bounds. Knows no rule. It's not a stage, it's not a process, it's something that stays. It's a reminder, a space that lurks in your mind and memory, time and time again. Grief, then, is not something to be absolved, but rather something you live with. Grief is an everyday thing, an everyday emotion. Like happiness or sadness, there should be griefness to describe how much grief we feel each day. Grief is not always about an actual loss. Grief is also the feeling of loss of everything that could have been. Sometimes, the loss of all that could have been, hits more harder. All those hopes, aspirations, daydreams, desires, plans. All those what-ifs, all the lives you could have led. There's so much pain the word could carries. Above all, I feel we're all grieving something or someone at all times. A person you used to be, a person you could have become. Someone you knew, someone you could have known. Let's honor our griefness today.#grief #mentalhealth #everydaylife

On November 19 of each year, I remember the most painful experience of my life, losing my older sister to breast cancer on November 19, 2013. While I miss her today, that‚Äôs true every day. This week was a busy one with two webinars to put on and a board meeting. Last weekend, my sons begged me to put up the Christmas tree and I said, ‚ÄúOk, let‚Äôs do it!‚Äù Their excitement was what I needed to fill my heart up for a big week. It was what I needed because it took me to a good place in my memories of my sister. She and I LOVED when it was time to decorate. I needed that because our final moments together aren‚Äôt where I want my head when this date comes around. Part of managing grief is getting out in front of it, and that‚Äôs why my Christmas tree has already been up for a week. My sister was the BEST. Today, I will honor her memory with fun. When we have a devastating loss in life, it‚Äôs hard. We can overcome it. Don‚Äôt suffer. Seek grief counseling. The person you lost would want you to go on. Living your best life is the best way to honor them. #grief #griefcounseling #griefawareness #griefandloss #griefjourney #griefrecovery

The older you get, the more tension you feel around the holiday season.You lose loved ones. Relationships are scarred. Life doesn't turn out how you thought it would.There's such a pressure to feel happy this time of year, but what we really need is permission to slow down and fully embrace the joys and sorrows of being human.If you're not feeling the toxic positivity of Christmas music, here's one of my favorite songs that captures the essence of bittersweet holidays."Let our bells keep on ringingMaking angels in the snowAnd may the melody disarm usWhen the cracks begin to showLike the petals in our pocketsMay we remember who we areUnconditionally cared forBy those who share our broken hearts.""Snow," Sleeping at Lasthttps://lnkd.in/g9Bjq9YB#holidays #grief #mentalhealth

This hit me today. Especially as I reflect not only on the brokenness of my own life at times, but of the world at large when it shows us its darkness. These mass shootings are everywhere and affecting people I love. Is there anyone here that hasn‚Äôt been affected?It creates great big holes of grief and fear in my heart for people everywhere. And yet, I am determined to create magic in everything I do. Because it‚Äôs what keeps me going. Believing that the light will shine through the cracks. It‚Äôs selfcare Sunday. Be gentle with yourself. Pic: I did not crawl through the shards of my own brokenness to live a mediocre life. I‚Äôve prepared for magic.

My heart breaks for the family and friends of those lost in the Colorado Springs violence against the LGBTQ community. I‚Äôve been going back and forth between trying to make sense of it and finding some ultimate fix - each loop ending in defeat. In the chaos, I remember an Emerson quote that‚Äôs stuck with me since grade school; ‚ÄúTo leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; to know that even one life has breathed easier because you have lived ‚Äî that is to have succeeded.‚ÄùFor me, that begins locally. I can impact through volunteering, advocacy, donations, and learning. I cannot change the world by myself, but I can and will do everything within my power to break down roadblocks for those who follow.#lgbtq #grief #change

#leaving to me was a constant reminder of grief and uncertainty. I left familiarity more than I could have imagined in the past decade.And I always find myself doubting if what I did was right. Because with leaving, there is sacrifice, there is immense loss with every time I decided I had to go.While the opportunities abroad leave me breathless and amazed, I can‚Äôt help but think about the what ifs, if I chose to stay. Where would I be, what would I do?There is no wrong decision, and there is no regret - what I‚Äôve chosen to do is grow, and there is no shame in that. #opportunities #workingabroad #travel #development #foreigner #satisfaction #mentalhealth #journey #unpredictable #sacrifice #grief #courage #growth

We‚Äôve all heard about the five stages of grief ‚Äî denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance, but feeling guilty can be a monstrous stage of its own. According to psychologist, author, speaker, and expert on childhood emotional neglect, Jonice Webb, Ph.D., certain people are more prone to feeling this way such as those whose childhood was one of emotional neglect.Those who tend to bury their feelings and aren‚Äôt compassionate toward themselves are especially prone to feeling ‚Äúguilty grief."

My grandma taught me how to write. But she had to die to do it.Here‚Äôs what happened‚Ä¶My grandmother brought color, light, and joy to my life.¬†She gave me fairy tale worlds to immerse myself in.At bedtime, she‚Äôd narrate scenes from ballets while playing classical music.She recorded Faerie Tale Theatre shows for me weekly.She was so good at cultivating fairy tale worlds because she‚Äôd lived a fairy-tale-like life.She‚Äôd toured Europe with two traveling trampoline acts.¬†The act she joined at around 16 was incredibly popular.¬†A petite woman, she dressed in a French poodle costume while her friend played the part of a French maid training her dog.She brought color, light, and joy to my life.¬†And then she got cancer.By the time they found it, it had already spread. It was already to her bones.I was in third grade when my family uprooted from Long Beach to a tiny town in the Inland Empire to be with my grandmother, my mother‚Äôs mother.I hated it. All the place had was cows and flies.Even as a child, I knew my grandma was sick, but I didn‚Äôt dare imagine a world without her in it.But it inevitably happened.Her death violently ripped my heart away.¬†But her death also took my mother‚Äôs spirit.I didn‚Äôt recognize the new person my mom became. I wouldn‚Äôt recognize her again for a long time.The pain that grew inside me was an unhealing mortal wound.¬† The pain swelled, but I had no way to express it.I searched for ways to let it out, and I finally attempted to, by writing a note to my mom about how I wished I‚Äôd died instead of grandma.I didn‚Äôt want to live in a world where she wasn‚Äôt there.I poured my grief into this letter.¬†¬†Pain, tears, aching loss.A child meeting death for the first time.I scrawled out my grief in large, clumsy cursive on the lined paper my mother had purchased for school. As tears dripped down my face, they dropped onto the paper, blurring the blue lines.¬†I hid the note in her shoe. I wasn‚Äôt there when she found it. I wasn‚Äôt sure how to handle my feelings. I didn‚Äôt want to hurt hers with what I said. I just needed to be heard.The first thing my mom said to me after she read it was that my poem was beautiful. At the time, I didn‚Äôt want to hear that. Instead, I wanted my mom to somehow fix it.But she was right - it was beautiful. And little did I know that writing would be my way to ‚Äúfix it‚Äù for years to come.No, it didn‚Äôt make the pain go away, but it eased it. When my mom enrolled me in grief counseling, journaling would become an integral part of processing my emotions.¬†Even now, writing is how I process the world around me.So in a way - yes - my grandma did teach me to write.She just didn‚Äôt live to see it. In a way, it was her parting gift to me.This is why I do what I do. Because the pen is truly mightier than the sword.What‚Äôs your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù?#WriterForLife #HonoringHerLegacy #ContentWriter #FairyTales #Grief #MyGrandma #Ballet #Creativity #ClassicalMusic #AClassyDame #JenThePen

I am pretty serious about weekends away from work and yet I'm sitting in my robe on a Sunday morning, sending messages to connect two people I've been lucky enough to meet along the way. I think they'll enjoy, and perhaps benefit from, meeting one another.I introduce people as often as possible. It's a long-standing habit, much in the vein of my habitual response to learning something exciting being sharing it as quickly as possible. I feel a deep joy in introducing people, a true excitement in what they might find in their connection. This morning, that joy of connecting people and the gratitude I feel for these two people I'm connecting is keeping me connected......to my hope...optimism...and value of gritty determined stubborn love even as I join in the grieving for those injured and killed at Club Q last night. We live in a world of both/and, a world of violence and love, a world of community and combativeness. This morning, I'm connecting with love and grieving the hatred, and the pain that no doubt spurred it. Give it a go. Connect two people today who you esteem, who you think might enjoy, or perhaps even benefit from, knowing one another. It's a whole lot of feel good for a little bit of effort. #strongertogether #community #grief #networking #connection

So far I haven't had anyone say, "you'll survive" since my son's death. Most everyone has been extremely kind. I'm fortunate in that aspect of the grief process.And so, when I saw this graphic, I realized that, even in survival mode, we who grieve for our children can find pockets of happiness.Yesterday I met a woman who lost her daughter to suicide at the age of 15. That happened 24 years ago and she's still in survival mode much of the time, unable to make sense of it. As we talked, she admitted that she often had thoughts of taking her own life just to escape the pain and guilt of not seeing the 'signs' in her daughter.  What kept her from it was the thought of abandoning her other child, her son. She's a warrior in so many ways and I was humbled by her willingness to confide in me. Now we have both met a new member of our soul tribe who 'gets it.' That brings us a little pocket of relief and happiness. There are no coincidences. The Divine arranged our meeting ‚ù§Ô∏è#grief #survivalmode #childloss

Just 5 months ago, I buried my number 1 son (my firstborn). Yesterday, we buried my grandmother, our beloved and oldest family member. My grandmother was buried next to my daddy who transitioned right before Thanksgiving in 2019and my great grandparents whom we adored.Burying loved ones is difficult. Living after loved ones have transitioned is different. Nothing is the same without their physical presence. Grief is a lonely business. Healing is a journey. The new podcast, Grieve, Heal and Live,  was started to help myself and others who are dealing with loss to keep going. The podcast aired on Spotify on Thursday, Nov 17, 2022.  To listen anytime, download the Spotify App, Search for Grieve , Heal and Live. Episode 1 now available. I hope you‚Äôll listen in. Remember this‚Ä¶‚Ä¶that grief is love, healing takes time, and we only have one life to live, so let‚Äôs aim to live our one life with Joy! #grief #heal #live #joy

This will be the first year that our grandparents won‚Äôt be with us for the holidays.  Navigating through the grief of losing them has been a daily struggle as I realize just how much they are on my mind and the depth at which I feel their absence.  I was given some really good advice from a friend who I admire greatly who is very familiar with loss.  If there is even the slightest chance that it can help someone else through the holidays I wanted to share what she said: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think of the memories you have with sadness, as something you will no longer do. Those memories are forever.  The times you spent together were precious and they know that you loved them.  Instead remember those times with fondness and use them to build new memories while honoring traditions, advice that they gave you and things that they did that make you think of them.‚Äù This was really profound.  While it doesn‚Äôt ease the pain of loss it did make me think: I have the opportunity to spend the holidays with my little family and we will incorporate some of the things that we would have done if our beloved grandparents were still here. Instead of remembering this year as the first holidays without our grandparents we will make epic memories and live our lives to the fullest the way they would‚Äôve wanted us to.  Their love was a gift that we will always treasure #grief #loss #youarenotalone #itsokaynottobeokay #memoriesareforever #begratefuleveryday #grandparents #thankful  (photo taken by me last holiday season in Mystic, CT.

We ALL need this at some point, right? Especially dad's who often feel pressured to NOT to display this part of our heart and emotions. When my son died, I didn't fully grieve.... I felt there was no time as my world continued to turn and I had a broken wife and 4 other kids to love and continue to nurture, BUT....I look back with a longing to have let it go then, as I still deal with it today.

Taking your breath away powerful!This speaks to grief in such a perfectly visual way that all can understand and appreciate. I have noticed there are so many grieving on LinkedIn and whether they post about it often, or only just once, it is still extremely important and cathartic.I am wanting to give those who have lost someone a place to even for a moment, bring their loved ones back. Not seeing their face and hearing their voice anymore is excruciating...but not hearing anyone say their name or have them be included in the topic of conversation somehow is even worse. It almost sometimes can feel like they never lived at all.If you fellow Linkedin Humans have lost someone...I know I have said it before, but I will say it again...I hear you, I see you, and I understand.Feel free to share something about your loved ones here and at least have one place where you know they can gain life again.Grief is no joke, but it is something we all need to go through...and unfortunately, one day or another, we ALL will.Hug those you love a little tighter today and be grateful for the people, the memories, and the blessings in your life.#grief #griefjourney #griefsupport #griefandloss #griefawareness #griefquotes #grievingstinks #bettertogether #gonebutnotforgotten #wearehumansafterall #blessings #gratitude

‚ÄúBeing just 32 years old and suddenly losing my wife whilst pregnant with our second son, I knew I faced an immediate future of unimaginable challenges. Our 4-year-old son‚Äôs future was entirely dependent on how I managed to step forward from that very moment‚Ä¶Supporting my son with the most unimaginable loss he could ever face was my priority from day one and always will be.‚ÄùWAY member and Stong Men volunteer Ben, tells his story for #InternationalMensDayhttps://lnkd.in/eU7B6s7A#WidowedAndYoung #Grief #Bereavement #Support

"Portrayals of #Latines ‚Äî both in #LatinAmerica and in the #UnitedStates ‚Äî are overwhelmingly (and violently!) #white. This is by design. For generations, #entertainment #media has invisibilized and/or #stereotyped #Black and #Indigenous people with origins across Latin America, just as its #Spanish and mestizo white supremacist leaders have done in this region throughout #history. This is why seeing the #brown skinned Huerta playing a #Maya-inspired antihero is so powerful ‚Äî and it‚Äôs also why it‚Äôs not surprising to me that it took U.S. Black entertainment, not Latine media, to tell dignified stories of Indigeneity in a major #motionpicture.In the Marvel film, Huerta plays the feathered serpent God K‚Äôuk‚Äôulkan, or Namor ‚Äúto his enemies,‚Äù a character with both Maya and #Aztec influences. His underwater kingdom, Talokan, came into existence after Spanish-invading #colonizers decimated the #Yucat√°n peninsula with #disease. For the actor, the role isn‚Äôt important because it‚Äôs a #representation of Latinidad but rather because it reflects the people, lands, and #cultures that the #colonization and hegemony that created Latinidad tried to eradicate. ‚ÄúTo give this background to Namor, the #Mesoamerican culture, especially Maya culture, they nailed it.""In an interview, director Ryan Coogler (also) described Namor‚Äôs role as ‚Äúa character who leans into his #trauma, who owns it, and is comfortable existing in a state of perpetual #grief.‚Äù I think that‚Äôs a poignant, resonant framing for Black- and Indigenous-led #narratives. Wakanda and Talokan are both vibranium-rich #communities that have self-isolated for their own realization and #preservation. It made me think of #African and Indigenous peoples who formed maroon communities."

It‚Äôs an emotional listener letter for Emcee Q+A today. Most people don‚Äôt know this but there are over 40 life events that can cause feelings of grief and loss, and they hit us harder during the holidays. Alongside death that list includes divorce and separation, losing a pet, losing a job, a change in our financial state, a personal injury or illness, infertility, even the addition or return of a family member! These events and losses don‚Äôt get the healing and recovery they need. So as a grief recovery specialist, these are the conversations I want to have as we head into the holidays. Ep. 29 available now! Follow the link to listen! And WATCH the full episode on Spotify! #holidayblues #grief #griefrecovery

Tomorrow, November 19th is observed as International Survivors of Suicide Loss Day.Death is an occurrence that will touch all of us at one point in our lives, whether it is a close loved one, friend, acquaintance, or someone in the community. It may be an expected loss but sometimes it is sudden and can be tragic. In each of those occurrences, death is can be quite challenging, but the suicide of a loved one comes with its own set of complexities. Not to be confused with a person who survived an attempt, a suicide survivor, or a suicide griever, face similar grieving challenges, but it tends to be coupled with guilt, shame, stigmas, anger, and sometimes disconnection.

Dear Job Seeker,¬†I'd like to offer up this article as a gift.I wrote it two years ago to help me deal with #grief, #loss, and #burnout that accompanied the job search. ¬†For those who haven't looked for a job in a while, they really don't know what it's like. The automation of the process is often dehumanizing and can impact how you feel about yourself. You put in all this work and wait. Often you don't hear anything back and if you do, it's an automated email that can feel like a personal rejection. ¬†Not many #humans at companies are going out of their way to say, "We see you. Thank you for wanting to join us." ¬†I want to encourage you to #rest in this very difficult season. If you came from a toxic workplace and/or if you're grieving, you need to try to find a way to #slow down and #heal. ¬†If you can see this time as a #gift instead of a punishment or bad luck, you will experience a mindset shift. You will see opportunities that you didn't know were possible for you. Most importantly you can learn to see yourself differently, as being valuable, loved, and more than enough. These are things to be received and known, notworked for. ¬†All the best and #rest, Kayla¬†If you don't need this, please sent it to someone who does.¬†#beautifulsoapbox

Ten things I would share with other Mothers or surviors of suicide...First of all there are no words for the grief you are feeling and will continue to feel...2nd, this grief will hit you in waves, when you least expect it, lots of tears will flow....3rd, you will be sad and angry at the same time...4th, you will blame yourself..why didn't you know, why didn't you see, why didn't you do more...why....5th, you will cherish the photos, the cards and the  memories that you have.. because there will be no more...6th, you will want to be alone at times.. because others don't understand what you are feeling and might expect you to be back to "normal" after a time..7th, you will be more sensitive to others walking this same path..because only we really understand..8th, every birthday, every family get together and every  holiday there will now be a void...9th, you will miss them dearly... will want to hear their voice, will listen to old voice mails, watch videos, and look at postings on social media..to be near them again..  10th, as hard as this is...you will walk thru this, you can't avoid it...this is our new path......know you are not alone üíö #suicide#suicidesurvivor#youarenotalone#griefjourney #grief

Vandaag staat voor mij als coach het event: 'Geef kleur aan Verlies' in Utrecht op de agenda! Bij verlies hoort gemis en met dit gemis lijkt de wereld veel glans en kleur te verliezen. De leefwereld wordt als kleurlozer en grijzer ervaren. Beniewd naar de 4 verschillende coachingsmethodes die helpen kleur terug te brengen in het leven van cli√´nten  omdat kleuren nu eenmaal een sterke psychologische werking hebben en het verwerkingsproces kunnen ondersteunen.Altijd fijn om nieuwe tools te ontdekken die mijn coach-toolbox kunnen verrijken. En leuk om weer andere professionals uit het werkveld te ontmoeten! #event #kleur #color #verlies #loss #grief #toolbox #coaching #netwerken #verbinding #coachjekracht #uden #maashorst #oisterwijk #utrecht

The one thing I‚Äôve noticed on my morning commute train route is that every once in a while, a beautiful white birch tree pops up along the way. This reminds me of that morning about 4 years ago when I walked into my mom‚Äôs apartment and found her sitting up in bed looking out at the beautiful white birches just outside of her window (the ones pictured above). As she usually was still asleep whenever I would arrive, her being awake threw me off.  - ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to figure out how to tell my friends why I don‚Äôt drive,‚Äù she said. #mentalhealth #personaldevelopment #healthcare #publichealth #covid19 #grief

We don‚Äôt talk about.. ü§êI‚Äôve wondered for a long time why we hardly ever talk about loss, death, and grief at work. I mean, I do know why; they are just very difficult topics for most of us.And yet, death and loss are experiences we all share. They are part of life. But whilst we have made great strides in normalising talking about grief in our private lives, it is still quite a taboo at work. The fact this is my first post on LI about the subject (and I find myself nervous about it!) whilst I have always been very open about my own experience with grief, is pretty telling. The taboo is further demonstrated by the fact that many organisations are still working with archaic bereavement policies, and few have any meaningful processes in place to support a grieving employee. Hardly any workplaces provide training or offer other tools to leaders on how they can help navigate a team member‚Äôs grief at work.Even though there is a compelling business rationale for doing so; studies show that employees who feel supported by their employer after a bereavement are far less likely to go on long term sick leave and there is increased risk of an employee leaving the business due to a poor experience whilst grieving :/But an even more compelling reason is simply to be good to and do good for other people, especially those you work closely with. Kindness, empathy, and compassion are never a poor choice ‚Äì also in business üòä¬†So yes. This is what I really want to talk about, and I hope you will join in. Let‚Äôs normalise the conversation in the workplace around loss and grief. And let‚Äôs try to better facilitate the work of grief at work. Please do get in touch if you would like to chat about what this could look like in your organisation or if you are interested in learning more about possibilities for training & workshops on this topic.The video below is a re-take of a speech I gave earlier this year. In it I share a few lessons about grief in the workplace I gained from my own experience of losing my son Ethan, as well as some practical tips and suggestions for anyone wanting to support a bereaved colleague. I hope you will find it useful and would love to hear what you think ‚ù§Ô∏è#loss¬†#grief¬†#awareness¬†#griefsupport¬†#mentalhealth¬†#peoplefirst¬†#compassion¬†#empathy¬†#leadership¬†#purpose¬†#worklife¬†#employeeexperience¬†#workplace¬†#culture¬†#kindness

When you get your #pain diagnosis nobody really tells you about the #grief you will experience.You get your diagnosis, your prescription and are left to manage your pain.If only it was that simple... The way we grieve is unique to us as individuals. However, what we do have in common is that we grieve who we were before our pain diagnosis, we grieve the future plans we made as well as the things we enjoy doing. If you have been grieving for a while, you may feel stuck and not able to see a way out. You may even feel ashamed or guilty that you are in this position.And all you can think of is "How an earth do I move forward?" I can help you with this.#Resilience #InvisibleDisabilities#LongTermHealthConditions#ClinicalProjectManagers

We don't have to agree on everything to acknowledge the validity of each other's emotional experiences - the deep and important part of who we are. üíîIf someone's feelings make us uncomfortable, that's not a reason to demand that they bottle them up. üíîIf stirring someone's feelings relieves our boredom, it's definitely not a reason to pry. Forcing people to deny their feelings is not cool. Forcing people to express their feelings when they are not ready is not cool either. We can't all be therapists. But we can practice emotional inclusion. üíõEmotional inclusion means normalizing emotional truthfulness and honest answers to "how are you."üíõEmotional inclusion means checking the knee-jerk reaction to say the same old "you will be OK" and instead asking how the other person would like to be supported. Some may need space. Some may need a listening ear. You don't need to agree with everything to be a good listener - but you do need to care. And some may even need to hear that story from your life that you think is relevant. But make sure to ask them first.üíõEmotional inclusion means not judging emotions and checking our cultural and personal biases. People are emotionally diverse. If you feel yourself judging someone because they don't process emotions the same way you do, check yourself.üíõIf you design talent management systems, emotional inclusion means ensuring that cultural and power-based preferences for emotional expression are not embedded in¬†systems¬†for high-stakes decisions. Few jobs truly require a specific emotional profile that can be empirically validated.üíõIn workplace design, emotional inclusion means creating physical spaces to process emotion. Private and soundproof work spaces, preferably - these are¬†better¬†for our performance and wellbeing than open offices anyway.¬†Rage rooms¬†or¬†crying rooms¬†can help, too. Flexibility in when and where we work can make a difference. The availability of meaningful, timely, confidential help can make a difference.Emotional inclusion also means the prevention of emotional distress caused by work, be it from overwork or from ignoring concerns about bullying. It means providing training and resources for emotional understanding and inclusion. It means systemic transparency and psychological safety.#humanresources #emotion #mentalhealth #positivepsychology #inclusion #jobs #talentmanagement #people #training #safety #power #feelings #feeling #mentalhealthatwork #psychology #toxic #psychologicalsafety #leadership #diversity #emotionalwellbeing #diversityequityandinclusion #neurodiveristy #human #belonging #grief #fear #anger #anxiety #emotionalintelligence #toxicpositivity #work #happiness #joy #optimism #wellbeinghttps://lnkd.in/gaf2v7a5?

This is one of the best things I‚Äôve seen written about grief. Sharing ‚Ä¶ #grief #griefandloss What I Wish People Knew I've often felt invisible in my grief...because let‚Äôs be real and honest here...grief makes people very uncomfortable. No one likes to see or acknowledge its presence. It‚Äôs force and depth not only makes people very uncomfortable...it often scares them.They don‚Äôt want it to happen to them and they don‚Äôt like the reminder that it could.I used to feel that I had to be invisible in my grief. I used to feel that if I was honest and open about how very much I missed the one I love, even after so many years, I would be judged or criticized...or even left by those around me.It's true...I've been judged and criticized, because people thought I should ‚Äúget over‚Äù my grief, and that I was wallowing in it. I've been told I wasn't "very spiritual or evolved‚Äù because I continue to grieve for the one I've lost. Each and every time that happens...it hurts. I'm a person who grieves the person I lost...and I will until the day I leave this earth.What I wish people knew is that these facts are true and also don't negate the good and joy in my life. I'm capable of living both. This continued grief doesn't make me weak, or unhealthy, or emotionally unstable. It makes me strong. It takes courage, strength, and bravery to love beyond death. It's hard to live in a world that wants to make my grief invisible.I wish people understood that while our society runs from grief and death...I don't. I'm not afraid of the hugeness of grief and emotion. I've withstood a loss that battered the very heart in my chest and yet it still beats, still loves...and still lives.Here's the thing...what I wish people knew is that the silence and the concern about my lack of letting go doesn't help me...or anyone else. But listening, loving, and accepting me wherever I happen to be, does help me. My putting on a happy face for them may make them feel more comfortable, but it also damages our relationship and hurts me deeply.My continued grief doesn't mean I haven't accepted the loss of the one I love. Trust me...I know what I lost. Accepting my loss doesn't mean I no longer want what I had back. I accept my situation. I'll just never forget...or stop feeling sad about what's missing in my life. What I wish people knew is they can't fix me. No words and no actions can fix my loss. It can't be fixed...because there's nothing to fix. Gary Sturgis - "Surviving Grief"

Sadly too many of us relate to this.Please lead by example with your son's, we MUST change the 'Power, Control & Privelaged Culture and put an end to Family Violence.‚ÄúAny act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivations of liberty, whether occurring in public or private life‚Äù¬†Violence against women affects women‚Äôs well-being and prevents them from fully participating in society. It impacts on families, the community and the nation.¬†Violence against women is a gendered issue¬†To prevent violence against women, we must understand its gendered nature:Women are far more likely than men to¬†experience sexual violence and violence from an intimate partner, and with more severe impacts.Women are more likely than men to be afraid of,¬†hospitalised by, or killed by an intimate partner.Around¬†95% of all victims of violence, whether women or men, experience violence from a male perpetrator.Violence against women occurs across cultures and communities. It takes many forms, including physical, sexual, social, emotional, cultural, spiritual and financial abuse, and a wide range of controlling, coercive and intimidating behaviour. Regardless of the form it takes, it is understood to be most often used by men and its impact is to limit and control women‚Äôs independence.¬†It‚Äôs important to understand that violence against women does not always need to involve physical abuse ‚Äì often other forms of abuse (for example verbal abuse and threats, social isolation, limiting access to money) can be enough to impact a person‚Äôs behaviour and cause them to be fearful. Women often describe these non-physical forms of abuse as being severely damaging to their self-esteem, independence and wellbeing.Please, please, please seek help üôè#parentinglife #parentingtips#parenting #lifelessons #live #life #stopchildabuse #stopthesilence #familyviolence #violence #bully #bullying #pain #grief #boys #son

In my world, every day is Children's Grief Awareness Day.  I have the honour and privilege to work with so many youths and their families at a time in their life that is often devastating.  Grief can be normalized in our everyday conversations, and we can all learn to be comfortable in the uncomfortable and help share the weight of grief that is carried with our friends and family.  Iwant to sincerely thank all of you who participated in this lunch and learn with me on Thursday, November 17th at 11am.  If you did not make this one no worries, I will be doing a similar teaching in December with OISE.  Grief is very present in our youth today, even if it is not death loss.  Youth are experiencing many losses caused by the pandemic.  Thanks again to all those who chose to Educate, Equip & Honour on Children‚Äôs Grief Awareness Day!Stay tuned for details for next online webinar! #Jagvillage #jorjaonmymind #childloss #siblingloss #parentloss #friendloss #pandemicloss #childrensgrief #childrensgriefawarnessday #normalizegrief #itsoktonotbeok #love #life #death #dying #grief

I‚Äôm excited to share the #passionproject I‚Äôve been working on for over two years. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll Always Have My Love‚Äù is a picture book of comfort and commemoration for kids (and hopefully adults too) experiencing grief and loss. Nearly 8 million children lost a parent or caregiver to the pandemic. I lost my mom when I was 11 and it was so difficult for my family to talk about her, so we hardly ever did. We lost two of our closest family members over the past few years, survived by children and grandchildren. I hope this book makes it easier to cope with grief and loss. <3 The paperback and ebook are available now and the hardcover will be available soon. Thanks so much for checking it out! #love #grief #loss #books

Janet is the opposite, and doesn't rise till ten.Sarah made a special card, for each and everyone.She did this sitting on the beach, while soaking up the sun. Samuel went out to the shed, in the middle of the night.He grabbed the axe and chopped the wood, until it was first light. George took out his little boat, and sailed across the bay. We may be family, we may be friends, but we each grieve in our own way. Peter flew off the handle, anything set him off. Pat put a message in a balloon and gently set it aloft. Tui simply went to bed and hid under the sheets. She couldn't bear to leave the house, it's now been several weeks. Jane cleaned the entire house, from room to room she went. Till the house was cleaner than it had ever been and all her tears were spent. Leo couldn't wash at all, he didn't shower for days. We may be friends or family but we grieve in different ways.Mark just HAD to go to work to"take his mind off things"Melissa walked to the park at dusk and sat quietly on the swings. Bethany went down to the gym, she didn't do this for fun, And if that didn't help ease her pain, she'd head out for a run. Patricia looks like nothing's wrong, that not a tear was shed, Plenty have been but no one knows, she only cries in bed. So please be kind and gentle when loved ones pass away, For each of us will be grieving in our own and special way.

Sometimes the holiday season is hard. I lost my father four years ago in December and I often struggle with knowing my daughter will be away for two weeks during Christmas. As the years have passed since my father‚Äôs death, I have entered on this amazing healing journey. It has taught me how to stay in the moment as well as seek guided meditations when I identify with being off track. Mental health is nothing to make light of. You never know when someone else is struggling. Be patient, show love and kindness. You never know when someone needs your smile. From our hearts to yours, a piece advice for the holiday season: do your best,  preserve your mental health, understand your triggers, and most importantly learn to love yourself in your darkest moments.

4 Tips to help cope with loss:Get support: the single most crucial factor in healing is support from other people.Turn to family and friends. Even if you are self-sufficient some people want to help-tell them with what you need.Draw comfort from your faith-for some praying or meditation can help. Talk to clergy if comfortable doing so. Join a support group. Grief can be lonely-sharing sorrow with others who have experienced loss can help.Share this with someone who may need some help coping with loss.#loss #grief #griefjourney #griefsupport #mentalhealth

A Letter to Grief:Dear Grief, You were an uninvited and unwanted guest to my life. You came into my life like an unrelenting storm and hung on to me so tight  that on most days I felt like I couldn‚Äôt catch my  breath. Every moment that should have been joyful and celebratory, even the birth of my second son, was tainted by your darkness‚Äîby your persistent willingness to cast your dread, fear, and anguish into my once beautiful life. But I know now you were just trying to teach me how to live again‚Äîhow to breathe again without your death grip on my soul. That you needed to be the darkest of dark and unrelenting to give me an appreciation for the beauty of life. You taught me that you actually ARE love. That by feeling you and your presence, I still can carry the love for the person I lost forever. You taught me how beautiful sunrises and sunsets can be. How the cool wind on my cheeks and the warm sun on my face can feel like the biggest hug from the heavens. How melodious my children‚Äôs laughs can sound, how freeing it can feel to laugh until I have tears in my eyes. You exist so I can remember the kind of love that I know is capable for me in this lifetime. So now Grief, I do not fear you, or curse you, or wish you away. I embrace you and hang onto you because I know now I need you and I‚Äôll always need you. I never asked for you, I never wanted you, I didn‚Äôt choose you. But you are here now, and I will carry you with me for the rest of my life‚Äînot as an enemy, but as a friendüñ§.........#widowlife #widows #widowed #youngwidow #hopeforwidows #griefislove #widowshelpingwidows #widow #widowspeak #normalizegrief #death #griefjourney #griefsupport #griefsucks #griefawareness #griefrecovery #refugeingrief #grief #k9officer #loveafterloss #policewife #leowife #griefhealing #lossofalovedone #lifeafterloss #bereavement #goodgrief #widowhood #growingaroundgrief

What is a family caregiver?A family caregiver is any relative, partner, friend or neighbor who has a significant personal relationship with the person receiving care. They provide a broad range of assistance for an adult or older person with a chronic or disabling condition - one-on-one assistance daily to ensure that they are healthy and safe.A formal caregiver would be a volunteer or paid worker from a formal service. Why are family caregiver's so important?This role is huge in hospice care. Family caregiver's provide a lot more than physical support, like emotional support. Emotional support is always needed during this time and it can make a huge difference in the quality of life of a person receiving care. It is all about helping them overcome this obstacle and helping them feel as comfortable as they can. ‚ù§Ô∏èüè†For more information on caregiving visit our website belowhttps://lnkd.in/gMidA6Z4......  #hospice #hospicecare #palliativecare #hospicenurse #endoflife #healthcare #charity #endoflifecare #love #family #grief #palliative #caregiver #nurse #homecare #death #bereavement #fundraising #care #seniorcare #griefsupport #deathdoula #homehealth #ptsd #nurses #support #mentalhealth #hospicelife #community #homehealthcare

When a person experiences pain and sadness as a result of a loss, it is a natural and normal process.  In our attempts to help make everything better, we usually end up repeating a lot of unhelpful behaviors which can leave the griever feeling worse.  One of those unhelpful behaviors is assuming that a person who is grieving wants or needs you to fix them.  They are not broken.  Instead of going into fix it mode when someone is talking about their grief experience, simply listen.#grief #griefrecovery #loss #divorce #separation #conflict #conflictresolution #childrenswellbeing

ABOUT JENETTA
Jenetta Barry is a Mental Health Support Specialist, corporate trainer and personal-development coach, who works through both on-line consultations as well as face-to-face consultations in Harley Street London. Due to personal tragedy/loss Jenetta has dedicated her work to healing her life, having walked the walk and talked the talk. This led her to find the basics and expand her work further through the formation of The Epiphany Process. Jenetta also certifies life coaches in her signature process for applying accurate mental techniques in one's daily life. While Jenetta has been associated with several headline cases, she is equally inspired to share her ‚Äúmental health toolkit‚Äù with organisations and individuals who use them to overcome everyday challenges.

The Epiphany Process‚Äô charity arm - World Jenny‚Äôs Day was created from the realisation Jenetta's daughter, Jenny, had died on World Mental Health Day - 10 October.  World Jenny‚Äôs Day is now held annually using theatre and the arts to normalise and soften conversations around suicide and depression and their solutions and to also celebrate Mental Health Wellness. Jenetta is also a published author (Full-Circle Rainbow) as well as having had her life-defining story published and featured alongside Dr. Bernie Siegel, Dr. Michael Beckwith (The Secret) , Dr. John Demartini (The Secret) and Dr. Alveda King (Martin Luther King‚Äôs niece).

Not sharing for a pity party but this is my lovely husband who died 14 years ago today when our son and daughter were 7 and 3, not long after this photo was taken actually. Colin was a fisherman and died when his trawler capsized in a freak storm on the Essex coast. We did not have his body for almost a year so could not get a death certificate and prove he was dead which meant we couldn‚Äôt have a funeral or sort out his affairs - it was a terrible time. But, we survived - Faith, Family, Friends and Tim Jenkins and The Fishermen's Mission  supported us emotionally and spiritually as well as arranging grants for us to be able to survive. if you are considering a charity to support this Christmas, please consider The Fisherman‚Äôs Mission. Did you know ONE in TWENTY fisherman die or are seriously injured during the course of their working lives? Fishing is THE most dangerous civilian job in the world and The Fisherman‚Äôs Misson do an incredible job of supporting fishing families in hardship. This is my favourite photo of Colin and the children. It is bittersweet and so innocent - off for a day out in London. Who could have known we would all have so little time left together? Sometimes losing him feels like a lifetime ago, other times it feels like yesterday ‚Ä¶ the ‚Äònormal‚Äô rules of time don‚Äôt seem to apply to grief. I was very blessed to have this beautiful soul for my husband, even if our time together was short. I wouldn‚Äôt change it for anything. Life can change in an instant and none of us know when our time, or the time of someone we love, will be up.Lots of love to you all. Give one another an extra hug today.‚ù§Ô∏è#Bereavement #Trawling #FishermansMission #DeepSeaFishing #Widow #BereavementSupport #Loss #LoneParenting #Grief

The best way to help someone who is grieving is to listen. No fixing required... you can't fix what is wrong. Honestly... to fix means you bring someone back from the dead, and we know that's not possible. Do what helps, listen, ask about the person who they have lost, share stories, and just be with them. #deathanddying #griefandloss #grief #griefandbereavement #educateyourself #innersojourn #innersojourncounselling

The staff training is going really well and will be essential to all the work we do going forward.Do you have much work left to do before you can enjoy the weekend?I'm feeling a little overwhelmed so might need to break my schedule down into bite sized achievable tasks before I can tackle them.Have a wonderful weekend everyone!#LONov22 #grief #bereavement #hospicecare

Grief asks a lot of you. You grieve the:1. Initial loss2. Alternative reality that is now your life 3. Visions you had for the future 4. Version of yourself that existed before griefAnd you do it all at the same time. It‚Äôs understandable why you would numb, avoid or suppress this process.It‚Äôs overwhelming and encompassing. I help my clients slow down and feasibly be with their grief. I support them as they release what isn't theirs to carry anymore. I show them that honoring their grief and creating their future aren't mutually exclusive ideas. If you are stuck and feel guilty, shame, confused, or unsure about moving forward, please reach out.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, are nanosized structures released in the extracellular space. EVs are released by many cell types, are present in all body fluids, and are involved in intercellular communications. EVs embody the status of the producer cells. Thus, they may serve as i) indicators of health or disease states, ii) minimally invasive biomarkers for disease diagnosis, or iii) predictors of therapeutic response. Despite the importance of EVs, current EV isolation methods have limitations. Dr. Okeoma‚Äôs webinar will describe how her lab developed particle purification liquid chromatography (PPLC) as a superior EV isolation tool and applied it to discover that circulating blood plasma-derived EVs (BEVs) hold promise as minimally invasive biomarkers for predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. Her findings have direct relevance to clinical management of breast cancer and likely other malignancies.¬†#cancerresearch #exosomes #biomarkers https://lnkd.in/g7CWzvXu

No. 7 on #AFewOfMyFavoriteThings list for End-of-Life is for the #Grievers you know. @WidowWeDoNow has these two and many other t-shirts available on their website. I especially like "This is how I widow," because it shows the widow you are giving it to that you KNOW there is no right way to grieve the loss of the person you thought you were going to spend the rest of your life with. Do no harm to yourself and others is the only rule in widowing -- everything else is perfectly normal in widowing. Giving this t-shirt will tell your widowed bestie that you understand that. Loving "Resilient AF" for several reasons: "Resilience" is a weird concept to me so I love playing with it; the "AF" is modern and irreverent; and this is applicable to so many people who are enduring loss and other challenges, not just widows. These are definitely some of my #FavoriteThings2022 check them out. #Caregiving#MillennialCaregiver#CancerCaregiver#Caregiver Support#CaregiverLife#PalliativeCare#EndOfLife#EndOfLifePlanning#DeathPlanning#AdvanceCarePlanning#EstatePlanning#EOLDoula#DeathPositivity#Grief#SiblingLoss#Widow#GriefAwareness#Bereavement#Mourner#GriefJourney#GriefSupport#Thanatology#DeathCare#LastRespnders#MementoMori

National Home Care and Hospice Month in November is when we honor all professionals who work in the broad field of home care and hospice work ‚Äì this includes physicians, nurses, aides, social workers, physical therapists, and so much more. There are four types of hospice care: routine home care, continuous home care, general inpatient care, and respite care.‚Å†‚Å†Each requires a different skill set and comes with its own emotional and physical demands. Despite studies showing quite a high private home care value in the United States, the professionals who perform these services often receive very little pay, yet are committed to helping patients live and pass away with dignity. This month is for them.‚Å†‚Å†#hospice #hospicecare #palliativecare #hospicenurse #endoflife #healthcare #charity #endoflifecare #love #family #grief #palliative #caregiver #nurse #homecare #death #bereavement #care #seniorcare #homehealth #nurses #support #mentalhealth #hospicelife #community #homehealthcare‚Å†

Grief is always there, like work in progress underneath all you do in your life. However, it changes over time and moulds you into a different person. You can allow it to become anger and bitterness, or you can take the loss and use it to motivate you in your life positively. Will you choose to allow that loss to tarnish your life or make it appreciate everything you do have? It may not feel like a choice, but we all have a choice of how we respond to events in our life, we cannot change what‚Äôs happened but we can choose how to move forward with that. What do you choose? #lossofalovedone #grief #griefandloss #childloss #suddendeath #griefjourney #choices #motivation #grievingmother #hypnotates

-----------------------------
When I #speak at #events on #grief and #widows at #ministry and #church events and more all over the world, I mention and use this ALL the time.....I *very much dislike* the people that use that #phrase #getoverit.....If grief, especially a spouse, (but also other relationships) you didn't get #divorced (or lose them), you didn't #choose to leave and put that behind you.- he went to #heaven, so it's not like a divorce, where I put my life w him behind me....that will #NEVER happen. Example of Bryan DelkIt took me about 7 years before I dated, then remarried after 8 years, deciding to #MoveForward in my life, but I am never *moving on*.....Yes, there is a BIG #difference and if you have not lost someone SUPER close to you - you might not understand it - and you won't till you do.....I never even came close to knowing how it felt till it happened...and I pray you never do.....SO sweet Kevin made a special cabinet and we have a *memory area* where he keeps some things of his late wife he wants to keep, and I keep some things of my late husband I want to keep.....we both strongly feel *they* met in heaven and got us together down here.Plus the almost 10 other major losses I have had the last several  years.....I didn't choose to lose them - ......I will always love and miss them and never *move on* from that.....Same w my Mom,Jacalyn Baxter LantripNow I #CHOOSE #WeAllHaveChoices to live my life to the fullest and try to the way #God wants me to, as that is what those that have gone on before me would want for me.....Yes cry, yes get angry, yes beat your pillow if that makes you feel better....but then get up and move forward.....cuz you are still breathing for a reason...... #MakeADifference in your #Dash while you are here ‚ù§

One of the most unhelpful things we can do when we are grieving is to attempt to force ourselves to feel differently when we do.It is a form of ‚Äútoxic positivity‚Äù when we try to pretend that everything is okay and that we are doing amazing, while ignoring the pain and sadness we feel inside. In order to fully experience true joy and gratitude, we need to choose to be present with ourselves through all of our emotions‚Äîboth ‚Äúpositive‚Äù and ‚Äúnegative‚Äù and realize that all of it is part of the complex and beautiful human experience. #grief #griefrecovery #gratitude

Today is National Adoption Day ‚ô•Ô∏èNational Adoption Day is a collective effort to raise awareness of the more than 113,000 children waiting to be adopted from foster care in the United States alone. After getting to know a few foster moms in Manitoba I continued studying how the unstable situation affected moms and kids, and what happened after there had been an adoption.I also compared my experience with Bert Hellinger's view of adoption. He is the founder of Systemic Family Constellation Therapy.It's difficult to put it in short form into a post, but I wasn't surprised that most of the kids developed CPTSD and often carried it through their whole lives.I've also worked with mom's who gave their children up for adoption and with adopted "children" who came to me as adults.There's so much trauma and I think today is a day to raise some awareness about it.https://lnkd.in/g4bAq5swww.balanching.orghttps://lnkd.in/ghZRSapF#trauma #grief #mentalhealth

When someone is grieving a #loss, one of the things that they are often advised to do by those trying to help them is to be strong.  As anyone who's ever heard this knows, it is not very helpful.  It is not fair to ask someone who is grieving to push down how they are really feeling and put on a strong front for others.  This often happens in situations where children are involved.  Adults feel that they cannot let their children see that they are hurt by the death of a loved one or the breakup of their marriage.  They feel that they have to be strong because they don't want their children to experience sadness.  But the truth is that they already do.  To the contrary, it is very healthy to just be human and experience the sadness and all the emotions that come up while you are grieving.  Allowing your children to see you grieve will teach them that it is healthy and normal to feel their feelings when they are sad.  When done with the proper guidance and tools, it will also help you to model how to properly process the grief and sadness that they are feeling.  This is a skill that will serve both you and them for a lifetime since we all experience many different significant losses throughout our lives.#grief #griefrecovery #divorce #death #separation #coparenting #childrenswellbeing #conflict #conflictresolution

We hold on through fear, the unknown and through the misunderstanding of something new. We fear that if we let go we will have nothing left, be without and alone. Yet the truth is we can only take hold of something new with an open hand, palm upturned and ready to embrace the new. If we keep a closed grip, it becomes tighter and we have no space to take on something new. We begin to experience pain, either physical, emotional or mentally and it becomes the normal. We learn to live with it as our baseline and eventually believe it is what we deserve. The letting go is scary as it invites the unknown territory and path that we fear. For as much pain is caused by the known and already experienced, the unknown holds a greater weight. So instead of letting go all at once, do it little by little. Sit in the comfort of its achievement before letting go again.

I was in my 30s when I figured out that my annual struggle with illness over the holidays had a very real emotional and physiological source.

Today I am celebrating the life of someone very special to me; my dad.Many don‚Äôt know, as I share what I want to share on social media, but my dad passed away last year.Life works in very mysterious ways.The day after I handed in my notice and decided to leave the classroom in search of more freedom and flexibility, was the day we found out the unfortunate news: my father was diagnosed with cancer. For months, the GP misdiagnosed him and sadly, the future looked a little less bright.This is the first time I have ever shared this online. Why?Although my decision to leave the classroom was to be present for my daughter (who was 18 months at the time); the choice I made provided me with the opportunity to be there for my father too.You see change isn‚Äôt all that bad.Alongside trying to start and grow my coaching and education business; I took on the responsibility to care for him. And my goodness, it was tough. Shout out to all of you carers out there.Throughout a pandemic, with a little one, growing my business ‚Äì 2020 to 2021 will never be forgotten. I had to make the tough decision to isolate and unfortunately, my Mum and siblings couldn‚Äôt be in our bubble, and to top it all off, I had a car accident whilst on my way to take my dad to a chemo appointment which triggered the worst back pain.Fast forward to today‚Ä¶My lantern shines bright in my garden as a symbol of him.Grief can be a tough journey to ride and people express their grief in many ways. For me, gratitude was the most powerful healer.I am grateful to have called this man my dad.I am grateful my daughter got to meet a man who will forever hold a special piece of our hearts.I am grateful to have been gifted a son, who I know was from him.Rest in eternal peace Dad and Happy Birthday!Rebecca#dad #RIPdad #HappyBirthday #gratitude #grief

Happy Sunday!!Hey, Faithers! It is Day 20 of the 30-Day Linkedin Challenge.ü¶ã Where is your industry headed? ü¶ãI believe the field of Social Work is heading more towards advocacy and Social Workers learning their worth. I see a lot of social workers doing their own thing and creating their own programs and organizations. Even with the Social Work programs that are in existence; there is so much change and advocacy needed. I envision a lot changing with the Licenses and Curriculums (and hopefully the right changes because of the shift.) I can't predict a for sure a positive change but what I do see is one of two things:1.) People leaving Social Work because they are completely burnt out and most are burnt out even before their first job because the of curriculum requirements (practicum and supervision), having to work multiple jobs and people not wanting to pay social workers.2.) Social Workers leaving nonprofits and other organizations and creating their own because the systems created are not realistic or diverse or updated or advocated for.I foresee this Industry heading Into a direction where respect, advocacy, policy and pay will be demanded or other Industries will see what It Is like not to have social workers assisting them.‚úÖDay 20 of Linkedin 30-Day Challenge Completed ‚úÖ#loveyouthewayyoulovetheworldüåé #work #community #linkedin #people #postwithTrinity #30DayPostChallenge #grief #healing #selflove #selfcare #selfloveistruelove #selfcareisthebestcare #writing #journaling #socialwork #MSW #community #network

Sometimes the most powerful testimonial is simple and to the point. While I so appreciate their kind words üôè I share more so others will not only know there is way to the other side of their pain but they can hear from others that it truly works. So many suffer with unresolved emotions because they believe there is no way past the pain.It is important to know that The Grief Recovery Method has been proven to work when nothing else has. If you are seeking the assistance of someone who understands grief and knows the correct action steps to take following a death, pet loss, divorce, break-up, move, job loss, loss of trust, loss of health, loss of self, or any other major change or transition, I would be honoured to support you.PS: I will always protect your privacy which why there are no names attached to the testimonials.

Happy Saturday!!Hey, Faithers! It is Day 19 of the 30-Day Linkedin Challenge.ü¶ã Share a Tip ü¶ãMy tip is to give yourself permission to grieve, whatever you are grieving. Recently, I have been grieving the old me, and as I have endured this healing journey and spread my wings, I look back and see the person I used to be and grieve her. One thing that has been reaffirming for me is the grief groups that I lead, and two, allowing my mind, body, and soul to do what it needs. When you give yourself permission to grieve then your body has the freedom to heal. My biggest tip is to give yourself permission to grief and feel what you feel so you can heal.‚úÖDay 19 of Linkedin 30-Day Challenge Completed ‚úÖ#loveyouthewayyoulovetheworldüåé #work #community #linkedin #people #postwithTrinity #30DayPostChallenge #grief #healing #selflove #selfcare #selfloveistruelove #selfcareisthebestcare #writing #journaling #socialwork #MSW #community #network

The experience of #grief touches everyone in different ways at different points throughout our lives.  How we grieve a specific #loss is unique to each individual.  For example, three people may have lost their father.  Person one may be crushed by the loss and begin to enshrine their loved one.  A second person may feel anger and hatred towards their father and being to bedevil him.  Still, a third person may not have had a relationship with their father; therefore, they may feel guilty because they think that they should feel sadness when they don't.  There is no right or wrong way to grieve.  Whatever you are feeling is exactly what you are supposed to feel.  How do I know?  Because you do.  #grief #griefrecovery #divorce #separation #coparenting #conflict #conflictresolution #childrenswelbeing

We can only ever be responsible to the self and for the self. It‚Äôs often where most complications arise as they entwine with others and confuse the boundaries. Once the realisation is met that we are here for our own learning journey we are able to comprehend the weight we hold that is not even our own. Often trauma has shaped those responses and it‚Äôs from that same trauma that we and react to other forms of experiences. By healing the trauma we in turn redefine and reshape our responses into healthy and positive ones that best serve the self and it‚Äôs learning through life. #learning #trauma #react #healingjourney #healingtrauma #trauma #traumahealing #traumarecovery #defences #depression #depressionrecovery #mentalhealthmatters #mentalbreakdown #recovery #awareness #mindfulness #grief #grieving #beforeandafter #understanding #embracethejourney #embraceyourself #embracechange #help #environment #childhoodtrauma

#YourGriefYourWay Entry, November 19: Around the holidays, the presence of ‚Äúthe empty chair‚Äù that your loved one used to occupy can seem especially loud. If you‚Äôre facing an empty chair at a holiday gathering this year, try honoring your loved one in a new way. Gather framed photos and set them at your loved one‚Äôs traditional place at the table, invite guests to leave a note of love in their chair, place fresh flowers or a favorite stuffed animal where they would normally sit, or offer the empty chair to a friend or family member who might not have a place to go this holiday season.

Not everyone who has gone through grief recovery programs with me chooses to use their name in the follow-up survey or for a testimonial, and that's A-O.K. with me. A lot of the process of grief recovery is a private experience. Then, with support and guidance, participants connect the dots of their past for themselves, seeing the patterns and recognizing the behaviors they've used to cope over time. And learn the framework for moving forward - beyond the pain of the past. As one of my participants shared, it is not easy! It wasn't easy for me, either. It was the first time I had looked at my past in its totality and realized how my experiences shaped my present-day behavior and beliefs. And as Trish shared in her testimonial, it was life-changing for me, too. I was ready to shed old skin and feel a renewed sense of self. This is work you have to be ready to do, and you need to want to be transformed. Moving forward isn't about forgetting or condoning. Recovery is a regaining of something that's been lost. When it comes to grief, we lose ourselves. We are changed by grief. But what that change looks like is entirely up to each of us. Are you ready for transformation? ü§ù The first-ever, Online Grief Support Group Program starts November 30th and meets weekly for eight weeks, plus a bonus session. ‚ú®More Info: https://lnkd.in/ggieAS_4Register: https://bit.ly/3hx1KlC#groupsupportprogram #griefsupportgroup #onlinegriefsupportgroups #griefrecoverymethod #healingjourney #cerfifiedgriefrecoverymethodspecialist #grief #healyourbrokenheart #griefandloss #lifeafterloss #griefsupport #griefjourney #traumaandloss #griefrecovery #helpmehelpyou #findingme #findingyourselfafterloss #griefhelp #grievingyou #suffering #griefsucks #griefawareness #griefinformed #lifeanddeath #deathanddying #sufferinginsilence #heartbreaking #unleashyourheart #unleashyourlife #theunleashedheart

Happy Saturday!!Hey, Faithers! It is Day 19 of the 30-Day Linkedin Challenge.ü¶ã Share a Tip ü¶ãMy tip is to give yourself permission to grieve, whatever you are grieving. Recently, I have been grieving the old me, and as I have endured this healing journey and spread my wings, I look back and see the person I used to be and grieve her. One thing that has been reaffirming for me is the grief groups that I lead, and two, allowing my mind, body, and soul to do what it needs. When you give yourself permission to grieve then your body has the freedom to heal. My biggest tip is to give yourself permission to grief and feel what you feel so you can heal.‚úÖDay 19 of Linkedin 30-Day Challenge Completed ‚úÖ#loveyouthewayyoulovetheworldüåé #work #community #linkedin #people #postwithTrinity #30DayPostChallenge #grief #healing #selflove #selfcare #selfloveistruelove #selfcareisthebestcare #writing #journaling #socialwork #MSW #community #network
