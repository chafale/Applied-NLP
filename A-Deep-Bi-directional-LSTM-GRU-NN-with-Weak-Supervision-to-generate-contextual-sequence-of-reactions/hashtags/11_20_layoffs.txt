It is very unfortunate to see many people are getting laid off in IT industry. #Twitter, #Meta and many more are in the list. If you are looking for a job in Tech industry, you can apply at #Visa. We are still #hiring and so far I have not seen any #layoffs in last 4 years (touch wood), even during the pandemic time (when Visa's revenue was badly impacted). That is the culture of Visa, we all are part of one family. You will get the opportunity to work on world class payment products. Here is the link  https://lnkd.in/gEezC2YG.  Please let me know if I can be of any help by referring you. Take care.

If you are an H-1B visa holder and were impacted in the recent tech layoffs there‚Äôs help available. Shruti Anand and I are creating a database of those who have been affected by layoffs and have sixty days to find another job. This can be an unnerving time and we want to lend a helping hand. We will amplify all requests within our network and share with recruiters/hiring managers we know. Please provide your information to us via this form - https://lnkd.in/gp4KgUcsWe are in this together and we will make it through these hard times. Folks who were not impacted please repost this post (or comment for wider reach) so we can reach those who might need our help. This list has some open engineering and product management roles for candidates who might want to apply - https://lnkd.in/gKDZEfKjThanks to Shreyas Doshi for sharing this.Update (November 8, 22): In less than two days we have received hundreds of resumes. These profiles span across software engineers, engineering managers, data scientists, product managers, program managers and some business/finance analysts. We‚Äôve shared the database with hiring managers with relevant positions who have the ability to sponsor work in the United States across companies like Apple Workday Cisco VMware Walmart JPMorgan Chase & Co. Pure Storage Sigma Computing (hiring!) Veeva Systems Dollar General and many many more. What started as an effort to help a few folks within our small network has grown in to something we weren‚Äôt expecting. The overwhelming response from the community to help shows that there is some light in this period of gloom. What we‚Äôll keep doing : reach out to more folks in our network to match open roles to applicants.What we need to do next: more formal outreach to applicants to see if they have been receiving any inbound interest and ensure that they do.What we need from you: Share this information with anyone who needs it. If you or your team is hiring please consider these candidates and reach out to me or  Shruti Anand with your work email address via LinkedIn DMPlease refrain from adding your information to the list if you were not laid off, aren‚Äôt on an H1-B or F1-OPT, have more than 100 days to find a job, or reside outside of the United States.

Unfortunately, I too was impacted by the #techlayoffs at Amazon Luna. There‚Äôs never a good time to get laid off but getting the news while on #maternityleave with a 3 weeks old #babygirl is less than ideal.I had a great time working and learning with everyone on the team but now I am looking for new opportunities, both inside and outside Amazon.I was working as Technical Program Manager with Luna team and have past experience as Quality Assurance Engineer with tech companies across multiple industries (healthcare, financial services and cloud gaming).¬†If your organization is currently hiring, or you know any recruiters who can help, feel free to DM me or tag them in the comments.

Sometimes, #layoffs are absolutely necessary for the survival of a company.However, most times they‚Äôre done by companies with plenty of cash in the bank, just to reach some arbitrary number ‚ÄúThe Street‚Äù wants. I‚Äôm proud to work for a company that plans for the long term and places so much importance on its employees.11,000 people are losing their jobs at #meta today. More than 3,000 at #twitter just last week. As much as I disagree with those companies, their products, customer experience and how terrible they are for our society, I can‚Äôt help but feel bad for those employees affected and their families. Those two are not mutually exclusive.Just in the last couple days I had a a few recruiters reach out with some cool marketing positions (but as you can tell I‚Äôm not going anywhere). If you‚Äôre a marketing leader looking for a new gig, reach out on DM and I‚Äôll be happy to pass along your name to these recruiters.

Recently there are layoffs from several major tech companies. Over 100k have lost their jobs and many of them are on H1 visa. I have many friends coming to me asking for advice about maintaining their visas and getting their green cards. There are some types of visas and green cards that are not or less effected by the layoffs. In other words, you gain better control of your own life by pursuing these visas/green cards.Here I list several scenarios and provide answers to some common questions:1, If you got laid off from Twitter/Meta recently but luckily got an new offer soon. Due to the change of employer, your PERM-based EB2/EB3 has to be restarted to keep the priority date of the earliest 140.2, But you have a Masters degree and two papers with around 10 citations. You may want to try EB2-NIW. Although EB2-NIW has over 10 years backlog for Indians and over 3 years for Chinese, but there is no need to do the PERM every time you switch your employer.¬†3, Now EB2-NIW can be expedited, but not as good as EB1A that can be expedited anytime. Simply put it, according to the USCIS policy, (https://lnkd.in/e37xUwQJ), any NIW case filed before or on Feb1 2022 can be expeditated by paying 2500$.4ÔºåIf you or your spouse are not Indian or Chinese, you do not have the backlog because now you are in the ROW category. Once your NIW is approved, you will get his green card in ~ 6 months, based on recent data points.5, If you have ~ 5 papers and 100 citations, you may have a good chance of getting EB1A approval. Currently EB1A has no backlog. I have helped many EB1A petitioners who have 60-150 citations.6, As a recent update in Dec 10, 2022, according to the Visa Bulletin For December 2022 (https://lnkd.in/eWDHsFwF), ROW starts to have backlog and EB1A may also have backlog soon.In addition, I will also discuss O1 visa and EB1B green card. These are employer sponsored, but better than H1 simply based on luck.7ÔºåIf you have ~10 citations, you may use O1 visa as a back up plan if you did not get H1 for three years. But you need to convince your employer to support you. I have helped 10 citations to get O1. It takes ~3 months to prepare all the documents and 15 days (with premium processing) to get the result.8, If you get your O1 visa, you have three-year legal working status and the chance to be selected in H1 lottery system again.9, You already prepared your O1 petition, why do not also submit your EB2-NIW petition, and strengthen your profile and aim for EB1A. I have helped someone with 61 citations, get his green card in one year.10, Another option is EB1B, the bar of which is super lower than EB1A. However, EB1B requires a employer to sponsor, but EB1B also has no backlog. As long as you get your 140 approval in the EB1 category, you will likely get your green card in ~ 6 months after 485 submission.#layoffs¬†#twitter #meta #amazon #google #h1b¬†#O1visa¬†#EB1A¬†#eb1¬†#tech #eb2niw

My time at Meta has come to an abrupt close, along with 10,999 others. Regretfully, I admit I deserved to be laid off.¬†These layoffs are meant to cut costs in response to decreased ad revenue and macroeconomic downturn. In my short tenure at Meta, I have been an outsized cost to the company.I have a confession. A confession that may be the reason Meta missed its third-quarter earnings.¬†I have been hoarding Quest protein bars from the micro kitchens. I am the reason there were never any protein bars in MPK 14.¬†Now, this may not seem like a big deal given Meta reported $27.71 billion in revenue last quarter, but at $1.88/bar these things aren‚Äôt cheap. I am deeply regretful of my actions.¬†For now, all I can do is wallow in my regrets, and hope that I have stashed enough bars to last me the upcoming financial winter caused by being unemployed and stuck with a $$$ Bay Area lease. I better start rationing‚Ä¶In all seriousness, I greatly appreciate the support of everyone who has already reached out. I am not sure exactly what my next steps are, but as a new free agent, I am open to opportunities in the Bay Area or back in Canada. Best of luck to everyone affected by the ongoing tech layoffs!#opentowork #opportunities #layoffs #meta #softwareengineer #metalayoffs(If you are a potential future employer as long as your company does not provide Quest protein bars you have no reason to be concerned about my hoarding habits. This habit extends only to Quest Protein Bars.)

This picture was taken at 3 AM on Saturday at Twitter's SF office. The motivation of this band stands out to me. In a few extremely quickly executed steps (and some mis-steps, probably), Elon Musk has converted Twitter from a monolithic big-tech to an agile band of builders. Its a dangerous competitor right now. In doing so, he has also changed the rules of the game. As a result, my hunch is that we'll see companies/startups drifting to the two extremes:- Move fast and Break things camp: Led by the current day Twitter, but closely resembles facebook of early days.- Move slow and execute with perfection: More like Apple of iPhone era. Big companies can afford this lane.This is also a cultural reset moment for Silicon Valley. Below are some controversial takes that hit a nerve: - "a revolt by the entrepreneurial capital against the professional-managerial class"- "more like a collapse of the jobs program for surplus elites..high status people who can‚Äôt really do much economically productive work"#motivation #tech #startups #work #layoffs #twitter #elonmusk

Happy Sunday, frens, strangers, acquaintances, future employers, future colleagues, so on and so forth. This includes you #HiringManagers, #recruiters, and #DecisionMakers lurking around these parts on a Sunday afternoon, depending on where you're at. But don't worry, you're more than welcome to stay in lurkerdom if you'd like. It's all good. But before you go, I'd like to talk w/ you about a fellow #JobSeeker and member of the #GreenBannerGang y'all need to meet, yesterday. Let's consider this another installment of my Job Seeker Saloon series, an initiative I totally made up as my way of helping my fellow job seekers w/ the aid of my growing platform to get the word out to you Powers that Be. After getting the official say-so from none other than NicAnne Lamoureux, I'm sharing her original post below. Check out the deets, and if NicAnne's just who you've been looking for to serve remotely as your company's next rockstar #EngagementManager, hit us up. Share this post, give it a signal boost, what have you. Let's see what we can do to help NicAnne ditch that damn green banner, get her off this dumpster fire of a job market, and into her next opportunity, ASAP! On that note, a little birdie told me that NicAnne would like some more followers to get to that nice even number. What say we help out w/ that, huh?Missed an installment? No worries! Just follow the hashtag so you don't miss a beat. Last of all, it's sad I even have to say this, but NicAnne, if someone reaches out to you and tries to sell you something, or sell you on a so-called "opportunity" that feels even vaguely sus, hit the pause button. If they specifically name-drop me, do nothing about it just yet. Tell me what they said, and what they're trying to sell you. We'll come up w/ some next steps together. Stay safe out there. Always do your due diligence. Awareness is the name of the game. Knowledge is power. #OpenToWork #HireMe #GreenBannerGang #JobSeekerSaloon #LaidOff #layoffs #LayoffsAndJobReductions

My first post on LinkedIn and I never thought that it would be like this. Last Wednesday I woke up to find out I was one of the many impacted from the layoffs at Meta.  I‚Äôm particularly bummed because I LOVED my job, it was a dream come true. I was fulfilled by my role, projects, and team members. I felt like I had a ton of opportunity for growth and was excited to be with the company for years down the road. And the people? Hands down, the best from top to bottom. This was an elite team. I have learned so much from these last three years, getting my first exposure of recruiting and having the opportunity to learn from the best in the industry.  ‚Ä®With that said, I am on the market and looking forward to making an impact at my future organization. I am a passionate, analytical person that truly cares about people and partnering with leadership and hiring managers to find the best suitable talent for their team. To my network, please let me know if you are aware of any Technical Recruiting/Sourcing roles, referrals or leads are greatly appreciated. My email is scott.mathew.perez@gmail.com.

‚ÄúThe tech industry, which had perfected the art of optimizing digital spaces for engagement and ad placement, was prepared to invest deeply in the next adventure. But it‚Äôs gotten smacked by post-pandemic inflation and rising interest rates, which has made this pivot harder to execute.‚ÄùFor those in the Tech industry, that weren‚Äôt working in the very late 90‚Äôs to 2008, we‚Äôve seen the layoffs and changes in direction before.I remember being at Scient when they were closing up shop, seeing Aeron chairs get sold for $100 on market street in downtown San Francisco. When the repo guys were picking up cars at work, and when the banks were collecting on loans that were made against stock options (God I‚Äôm glad I skipped all of that).It was an age of debauchery and the collectors came a calling. Now it‚Äôs a postpandemic reset.It‚Äôs a bumpy ride, it can be scary, but everything does recover, in time.I feel for those impacted by the mass lay-offs. If I can help, reach out, I will do what I can.</dave>https://lnkd.in/gZuxc-Rv #tech #digital #work #layoffs #recession

Waking up this morning to the news that¬†Meta¬†has laid off 11,000 employees, myself included was difficult to say the least. As upsetting as this is I know in my heart that there will be a silver lining to this that I just may not be able to see right now. I have been fortunate to work with some of the smartest, kindest, and just absolutely amazing humans in my time here and look forward to crossing paths with them again down the road. Meta has always been a dream company to work for and I am still so proud and optimistic for the future this company is building. I am sending all of my love and the biggest hug to those impacted by this and truly believe we will all get through this together. ‚ù§ With that being said, I am immediately¬†#openforwork - If you have any leads or openings please feel free to message me or comment below.#meta #metalayoff #opentowork #recruiters #layoffs #opentonewopportunities

I've been thinking more deeply about my relationship with work, and the companies I work for, for a long time. In a good way! Not in the "it's me, not you" way and not in the "it's you, not me" way. I'm someone who really *enjoys* what he does and whom he does it with. And that means I dedicate a lot of my time, energy, effort, and, perhaps most importantly -- emotions -- wherever I go. Whether I intend to or not! That's just me.As I age (I'm ancient now) and grow into being a dad (Elle is nearly 1!), I continue to pay close attention to how I spend my time and make sure it aligns with my values -- at work and at home.That's vague, so I'll get to the point: we should all be thinking about the next version of "work life balance" which can be extremely meaningful -- or meaningless -- depending on the business and your specific work scenario.As this article puts it, the #tech #layoffs are "a stark reminder that your company, no matter how much you give, won‚Äôt always love you back."#career #work #jobs #jobhunt #jobhunt2022 #jobhunt2023 #worklifebalance #business

Tech layoffs are nothing new--in fact they're incredibly common at large employers. I've been through several.If you don't work for yourself, a few reminders:1. Your company and coworkers are not your family.2. Your company does not love you.3. You are not the top priority of your company.4. No matter how stellar your performance, corporate employment decisions are ultimately financial, not relational. Your job is a business arrangement with your employer, not a friendship. Hard though it might be to accept, your worth to the company is ultimately based on your effect (or potential effect) on the bottom line.Always advocate for yourself. When it comes to employment, you are a business--so treat you employer as a business partner, not a friend or family. And like any business relationship, be prepared for it to change or end. #layoffs

This was true when I started my marketing career journey in 1989 and it‚Äôs true now. Upticks and downticks will happen; I think I‚Äôve been through 3. And while spend may increase or decrease, firing marketing is extremely shortsighted and will ultimately lead to failure.
-----------------------------
A few years ago, my role as Senior Vice President of Global Communications and US Consumer Marketing at a big multinational Fortune 100 company was eliminated. There is something sobering for those of us who‚Äôve achieved some modicum of success in corporate America when we lose our titles at big recognizable companies--anyone who loses a job if I'm honest. Candidly, I hadn‚Äôt realized how much I had knowingly and unknowingly traded on the currency of what came AFTER the comma when I introduced myself to folks. I enjoyed saying, ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Andrew McCaskill, Senior Vice President of This at There.‚Äù I, along with the person on the other end of that introduction, tended to find great value in what that title and organization said about me. My roles over the years have meant something to me, and to be out in the world still trying to have an impact with no title added a new headwind to accomplishing what I believe my mission to be‚Äîcreating platforms where consumers and professionals who look like me understand their cultural and economic power. People show up differently when their power is verified and validated, and I want to give that power to people‚Äîat scale. I discovered a funny thing; people don‚Äôt respond to your emails and phone calls as fast when you don‚Äôt have an impressive title behind your name or no longer wield a big corporate checkbook.But I made a commitment to work, and God blessed it. I know we don't always talk about faith in professional circles, but my faith has always been part of my professional journey. And I‚Äôm a Black gay man from a dirt road in Mississippi whose career isn‚Äôt supposed to happen--working in countries where I don‚Äôt speak the language, creating jobs and opportunities for myself and others while delivering great value to my employers. Even in America, that doesn‚Äôt happen with sheer self-determination. BTW, that's not a flex; it's a testimony. I've had a LOT of help. What comes after the comma should be celebrated; for most of us, we‚Äôve made great sacrifices for those roles. But if you've found yourself recently without a role or title, here's what losing that big job taught me: Roles Change--Missions Don't. When the time came, the right people answered my calls, and I was able to pivot and rebound. God, the universe, whatever you call the higher powers of destiny--will make room for your gifts. Take some time, remind your networks of your skills and experience, let folks know what you're looking for, update your LinkedIn profile and resume--and trust your gifts. Our jobs are important, but we are so so much bigger than our jobs. #faith #pivot #careers #layoffs #faithandwork

Almost 2 year old post but I think it‚Äôs probably still relevant as there‚Äôs been a lot of layoffs at tech and sundry companies and some folk might should consider starting their own biz.Only thing I didn‚Äôt mention below is to set a debt limit you‚Äôre willing to go into that you know you can crawl out of if the whole entrepreneur thing doesn‚Äôt go your way. There‚Äôs no guarantees but a forced break from being an employee might be just the push you need to go out on your own. The Rollout Crew will likely have some roles opening up in Q1 for what it‚Äôs worth. Good luck!#layoffs #entrepreneur

Vulnerable ask for all you wonderful femmes and #womeninproduct: I'd never dream of asking for engagement on a post if it weren't massively in service of leveling the playing field and helping people feel free, joyful, and fulfilled in their careers. So would you hit "like" or comment on this post to help its reach?üò± The guides I'm going to share in the comments contain comprehensive, **life-changing** content about how to a) accelerate your product career or b) break free of a corporate career for success on your own terms. It's completely free, and I want as many folks to get access to it as possible.üòª The connection will also allow me to be of service to more people in the future. I am so grateful and honored to be in this position, and humbly ask that you help me spread the word. üí™ If these guides went viral, I think it might actually have structural impact on how we work and how we feel. Together we WILL change work culture to be more equitable, joyful, and supportive for all. #womenempoweringwomen #productmanagement #layoffs #quityourjob #productmanagers

Unfortunately, my position has been eliminated following Asana‚Äôs layoffs announcement yesterday.Straight to the point, this is what support looks like for me right now:üéñÔ∏èReact (like, love, care, etc.) and comment to this post.üéñÔ∏èShare this post on your feed.And if you are feeling very helpful:üèÜ Reach out to your #Marketing network and share my LinkedIn profile with them.üèÜ Send me a list of companies you know are #hiringüèÜ If we have worked together in the past take a couple of minutes to write a LinkedIn recommendation for me.‚ÄúContinue reading only if you want to learn what my current thoughts are and what is next for me.‚ÄùWhen I was flying to Dublin on Sunday night to meet the team I never thought things would turn out this way and that I would be posting this today.Layoffs are brutal. Especially :1Ô∏è‚É£ Because they aren‚Äôt tied to individual performance but to business/operational needs.2Ô∏è‚É£ When you are on a business trip thousand miles away from home when you receive the bad news and have to spend the night by yourself at a hotel room in a foreign city (although the team took me for dinner and beers üçª before that).3Ô∏è‚É£ When you love your team, the company and the product.I am beyond than grateful to have been working with an amazing team that made my tenure at Asana  over the past 15 months an unforgettable experience. During this time I met so many people who are much more than just ex colleagues, they are real friends.Gabriela Baptista Samuel Goh Shane Lyons David O'Daly Alan McAuley Linda Underwood and many others (will not spam by tagging everyone, but guys, you know who you are). If you are wondering what is next for me, I am going to take a couple of weeks break to look after myself, workout daily, do things I always wanted to do but had no time for, spend time with important people in my life in Germany and back in Greece, take the level 2 freediving course, go spearfishing on Monday mornings, improve my windsurfing skills, travel (trip to Portugal üáµüáπ is booked).In my ‚Äúfree time‚Äù I am going to be looking for my next career step.

Being laid off sucks. But working for someone else sucks more. Hear me out...Owning your own business gives you flexibility, but beyond that, the beauty of franchising is that we gently guide you through the process as a first-time business owner. And however much you put into your business is however much you get out. And our business owners have gotten a LOT out ($$$$$) - believe me. My 20 years of franchising experience + your openness to something new = success.  Now's the time to take advantage of this pause in full-time work. We have some lucrative new franchise brands coming online soon.

üì£ I‚Äôve been known to call things as I see them. I want to call something out for a moment‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt help but notice how people posting about being laid off in these recent waves typically get WAY more support and opportunities compared to others I see on this platform who have been jobless for 6+ months and struggling. I‚Äôve made notes over the past couple of weeks, and it seems to be independent of follower count. Some have as little as 200-500 while some have 5k-10k+.Why is that? Are we only willing to help in more drastic situations? I have no ill-intention from this post. It‚Äôs simply an observation. Maybe it‚Äôs just my feed and people in my network? Regardless, we should always be willing to help, but that help should be extended to everyone.I‚Äôm sure it has to do with the algorithm picking those up more since mass layoffs hit the news, yada yada yada. It‚Äôd be nice if we could come together to help everyone seeking a job go ‚Äúviral‚Äù and provide support. What are your thoughts on this? Why do you think that is? ü§î #layoffs #jobseekers #opportunities #helpinghands
-----------------------------
I was going to stay silent, but I just saw a post condemning people who have shared an announcement regarding being laid off and encouraging them to keep it quiet. Yesterday I  saw a post from a current employee expressing they are ‚Äúhonored to be chosen‚Äù to still be employed.¬†I‚Äôm angry.¬†Layoffs are so much more than the shocking numbers, the % impacted, and the big headlines. Behind every layoff there are real humans with real lives that are upended. Real humans who are in a position they likely never expected to be in and now have to process not just losing their job but how that will impact the rest of their life.Behind every layoff there are real stories:A human who just came back from bereavement leave after losing a spouse.A human who just found out they were pregnant.A human on a H1B1 visa who now has to find a job quickly to stay in a country they likely love.A human on vacation trying to enjoy their honeymoon.A human who was laid off at the same time as their spouse.A human who was saving for a much deserved and needed trip for their mental health.A human who is home on maternity leave trying soak up time with their newborn.A human who needs health insurance for a chronic illness.A human who is thriving in their job and doing the best work of their career.¬†A human who was just getting started and was excited to make an impact.¬†A human who is so much more than a $ amount on a budget sheet.I hope that if you ever have the opportunity to be a Recruiter, a Sourcer, an Interviewer, or a Hiring Manager that you remember these moments. Check your bias and recognize that behind every short tenure in a position, gap in a resume, or decision to job hop there are real humans. That as you scan resumes, consider applicants, interview prospective candidates that you remember these are real people and sometimes they have no control over the detours they take in their careers.¬†#layoffs

The news is abuzz today about the tech sector and their space usage (lots of sublet space flooding the market).While the tech sector has been the main driver of net new growth for landlords, quickly changing dynamics are forcing many of those companies to return space in the form of subleases.It remains to be seen whether this is a short or long-term correction but Savills North America Tech Tenant will be watching and reporting on the latest tech market activity.Outstanding work by Eric Lonergan, Devon Munos and Jasen Dowell in creating the chart below.   #tech¬†#techblog¬†#news¬†#layoffs¬†#cre¬†#realestate¬†#sublease¬†#savills¬†#pandemic¬†#tenants¬†#tenantrep¬†#sanfrancisco¬†#siliconvalley¬†#nyrealestate¬†#austin¬†#seattlerealestate¬†#boston¬†#atlanta¬†#la

Today, I found out that I've been laid off. I'm joining many others who are experiencing the feelings that come with losing your dream job. I was with Amazon for 6 years. We have seen Alexa grow from its early days and it's been an incredible journey. I'm proud of what we built together.I'm actively seeking my next opportunity.¬†I'm reaching out to my network for positions in Backend Software Engineering (Product/Infra).I have 8+ years of experience, starting my career at Symantec¬†and then becoming part of Amazon. I'm on an H1-B visa so time is of the essence to find something new.If you are hiring or would like to share open positions, please comment below, message me on LinkedIn, or mail me at¬†kansagra.raj@gmail.com#amazon #layoffs #techlayoffs

It‚Äôs easy to see salaries and people as just numbers on a spreadsheet.But they are not. Every redundancy decision effects someone in a big way.This is my takeaway from I‚Äôm a celebrity last night as we watched Chris Molyes tell how he was unceremoniously exited from his top Radio DJ role. We know some jobs have to come to an end, sometimes financial circumstances often cause roles to be obsolete and people need to be exited from a business, but it is the way it is handled that is key.People are human, let‚Äôs not forget that. Chris Molyes was given less than an hour to accept and process his 15 year old career was ending.  No wonder he was angry and stressed!! We have seen the same lack of communication and respect with the tech layoffs this past month. Offboarding staff should be treated with the same energy as they were are on boarded with.And whatever the size of the company outplacement goes a long way to helping those effected manage the change.Would love to know your own experiences?#outplacement #offboarding #redundancy #layoffs #jobsearch

Hey everyone, unfortunately I was one of many impacted by the mass layoffs at Amazon this week. I had only started in August, yet I've learned a lot in my time working here in the Devices Org. Grateful for the experience I've gained and the people I have networked with.I am actively seeking new opportunities internal and external to Amazon. Looking for entry level software engineering roles around the San Francisco Bay Area, but open to opportunities outside as well! My experience is primarily in AWS cloud development (AWS CDK, Lambda, DynamoDB, Athena, QuickSight) as well as Java, Python, and SQL.Please let me know if you or anyone you know is hiring, and feel free to comment or message me.Thank you!#amazon #layoffs #amazonlayoffs #opentowork #opentoopportunities #newgrad #softwareengineers #cloudengineering

Recession and Layoffs - challenges that leaders should be ready ! With Meta , twitter and now amazon laying of more than 10k employees , the business leaders need to act now ! to ensure similar situations are not with their own teams ! As a leader  the best path i see is taking small but concrete steps so as to get Giant leaps !  1. Work on financial priorities  of company 2. Innovate with teams on ways to make work more efficient 3. Focus on Debt repayment wherever possible 4. Diversify revenue 5. Most important start relooking into the business model and coarse correct How do you see this as a challenge and what would be your strategy ! your thoughts please #smallstepsgiantleap #business #layoffs #recessionproof #leaders

Three things you should do right now if you are job hunting1Ô∏è‚É£ 2Ô∏è‚É£ 3Ô∏è‚É£ As #layoffs continue to be norm these days, here are three steps you can take right now if you find yourself in this situation - assuming you have already taken care of the essentials like signing up for #unemployment, figuring out your #healthinsurance options, updating your #resume, and reaching out to your #network üéØ1Ô∏è‚É£ Take some time to process what just happened - this is a great time to go inward and figure out what matters to you (your WHY), the actions and decision you can take (your HOW), and the results you want to achieve (your WHAT) üëâ Bonus: Read Simon Sinek's Start with Why.2Ô∏è‚É£ Take the Gallup CliftonStrengths and the Positive Intelligence Saboteur online assessments. Combined, these two assessments will give you great insights on what your strengths are and how you may be self-sabotaging üëâ Bonus: links to both assessment are in the comments below Once you have completed those first two steps ... 3Ô∏è‚É£ Keep an open mind and don't limit yourself - unemployment rates are still historically low, with estimates as high as 2-3 jobs for every candidate. The industries with the biggest growth right now? Check out health care, professional and technical services, and leisure and hospitality. Another stat to keep in mind? 69% of companies in the US are struggling to find top talent - that's YOU  my friendüëâ Bonus: reach out to people in those industries and ask for an informational interviewAs I mentioned in my post yesterday, I am available if you want to chat or brainstorm - just reach out to me üíØüéØWhat other steps have worked for you?ùòØ.ùò£. ùòê ùò¢ùòÆ ùòØùò∞ùòµ ùò™ùòØ ùòèùòô ùò¢ùòØùò• ùòê ùò¢ùòÆ ùòØùò∞ùòµ ùò¢ ùò≥ùò¶ùò§ùò≥ùò∂ùò™ùòµùò¶ùò≥ ùòâùòúùòõ ùòµùò©ùò¶ùò¥ùò¶ ùòµùò©ùò≥ùò¶ùò¶ ùò¥ùòµùò¶ùò±ùò¥ ùò©ùò¢ùò∑ùò¶ ùò¥ùò¶ùò≥ùò∑ùò¶ùò• ùòÆùò¶ ùò∏ùò¶ùò≠ùò≠ ùò™ùòØ ùòµùò©ùò¶ ùò±ùò¢ùò¥ùòµ ùò¢ùòØùò• ùòê ùòµùò©ùò∞ùò∂ùò®ùò©ùòµ ùòê ùò∏ùò∞ùò∂ùò≠ùò• ùò¥ùò©ùò¢ùò≥ùò¶ ùòµùò©ùò¶ùòÆ ùò∏ùò™ùòµùò© ùòÆùò∫ ùòØùò¶ùòµùò∏ùò∞ùò≥ùò¨#leadership¬†#connections¬†#network¬†#industry¬†#layoffs¬†#empathy¬†#hiring¬†Z Technology Solutions¬†Future Voices¬†In the Spotlight with Suha¬†#SavvySuha¬†#SuhaBeidasZehl #future #jobs #technology #healthcare #hospitality #professionalservices #talent

Hi Linkin family, As many others have mentioned, my organization PXT/ TA will be impacted #layoffs this coming Jan. While it aches my heart about the current situation that we‚Äôre facing, thus I never once forget what is the actually Day1. If I told you that there was an immigrant with roughly 20% spoken English skills , started as a temporary Amazon warehouse associate  in CLT, fast forward 5 years later, multiple internal promotions, that same associate achieved her American dream and makes it into the corporate world. Yes that was me! The first few days into the Recruiting Coordinator role, I thought to myself: ‚Äò‚ÄôOMG! What did I get myself into? I will give it 3 weeks otherwise I would step down back to a fulfillment center‚Äù. And a year flew by, I‚Äôm still here and making the impossible, possible. My HMs, my recruiting partners, my right hand BRs who saved my loops most time, and just like that recruiting earned a solid space in my heart. From 20% of English to scheduling, communicating, coordinating 5+ calendars of leaders up to L8. Wow, I have to just ‚Äúwow‚Äù at myself sometimes.If this is up to my performance to determine whether or not I get #layoffs then I‚ÄôD HAVE ZERO FEAR. But giving the unforeceseen circumstance, so for once I don‚Äôt know. All of this being said, Im ready to come out of my safe place to explore what‚Äôs else out there waiting for me? If your team or if you know of other teams that are looking for RCs, Recruiter, HR field please send them my way. My chapter doesn‚Äôt end here. I need my network help me to get attention of #SrHRleaders for internal opportunities #NC #GSO  #amazonlayoffs #recruiting #hr #Greensboro #remotework #hybridwork #backonsite

Hello everyone,¬†I am here to ask a favor from you people in one of the difficult moments in my professional career. Last week, many employees from my company were laid off due to the currently strained market conditions and decrease in business margins. Unfortunately, I was one of them.¬†I am currently looking for a job in Data related profiles as a Data analyst/Product analyst/Business analyst or Data scientist. For my previous employer, I have worked for over 2+ years in the domain of Analytics, Growth, and Customer Success and have contributed to key projects.Since the layoff was mainly market situation-based and not performance-based, my previous Manager & CTO will be very happy to provide their recommendations for any employer who might want to interview me.¬†I request my connections to please help, if they know of any relevant open positions in their company or somewhere else. I will be happy to show up for an interview and provide any information required.Thanks for your time. Hoping for the best response#layoffs #openforwork #opentowork #iitkharagpur #iitkgp #openforopportunities

What you can't control:- The economy- How much your job pays you- Your employer's decision for mass layoffsWhat you can control:- Your education- Your total income- Not relying on a single income streamWhether or not you've been affected by the economic downturn, I encourage you to take control of your situation.1. Spend an extra 1-2 hours each day/week becoming an expert in a skill you're already using at work. Get certified if possible.2. Create an Upwork or Fiverr account and apply to freelance jobs that require that skill. If freelance jobs aren't common in your industry, look for a part-time job that will allow you to work an extra 5-10 hours a week.3. Update your LinkedIn profile and resume with your new skills and experiences. Market yourself by adding people in your industry.Here are a few in-demand skills you can use to make cash today:- Sell Notion templates- Organize projects in Asana- Design Salesforce or Zendesk workflows- Create social media posts in Canva - Create charts and tables in Miro and Airtable - Build automated workflows in Zapier - Design chatbots with Ultimate - Book sales meetings using Gong- Bookkeep with FreshBooks or Xero - Configure WiFi networks with Ubiquiti Inc. - Market Shopify stores- Throw events with Eventbrite - Design reports in Tableau - Survey prospects with SurveyMonkey  - Send email sequences with Intuit Mailchimp - Answer customer questions in Intercom - Write articles on Medium - Design & develop sites with Figma and WebflowDM me if you're stuck and need help getting started.#freelance #jobs #layoffs #recession

#Layoffs are never easy for anyone.  They're not easy for the impacted employee, their family members, nor are they easy for the managers or the HR teams, but they happen.  And when they happen, you'll see networks and teams mobilize and collaborate to try and help out.  Which is the beauty of digital connections and platforms such as #LinkedIn. #Meta, #Twitter, #Google, #Amazon and now #Olymel have announced layoffs this week impacting a significant amount of people.  If you, or someone you know has been impacted by these layoffs or elsewhere and are immediately looking to secure something else, please have a look at #ABB's careers site and apply on positions of interest. https://lnkd.in/ep6P7mMQ Our talent team will be there to provide any additional info. #ABBcareers #CaringNetwork Rose-Anne Oumar Sara Christina F√©lix Sebastien

Note to my fellow #mortgageprofessionals who work in ops and are still gainfully employed, It‚Äôs important to start networking on LinkedIn now while you are working.  Why? Because should you be affected in the future the network you have built prior to a job transition really matters. You will be ahead of the game instead of lagging behind. ‚≠êÔ∏èEngage with the app‚≠êÔ∏è Have fun making connections‚≠êÔ∏èUse it as a resource to learn about as many things that you are able to inside and outside of the industry‚≠êÔ∏è Don‚Äôt wait to network ‚≠êÔ∏è Check in Daily ‚≠êÔ∏è Give recommendations to those you have worked with. Ask for recommendations from your network that speak to your work ethic and qualifications. ‚≠êÔ∏èDon‚Äôt be afraid to post regularly Liking posts is great, commenting is better. Good luck to all workers who have been affected by #layoffs If anyone else has anything to add please feel free to leave a comment üëáüèª  #linkedin #networking #future #connections #openforwork

Homeward had its second round of layoffs yesterday, which impacted 25% of the workforce, including myself and my entire Learning & Development Department. I met with my team today so that we can lean on each other as we always have. We will all be okay, because these folks are some of the smartest, and kind hearted individuals I've had the pleasure of working with. Any company would be fortunate to hire them.*****Recruiters: Please reach out to me if you're interested in connecting with any of these folks. This is the best team of L&D professionals, and I can speak for hours just on their accomplishments and strengths. Here's the super short version about each:** Ana Plankenhorn: The most engaging and authentic stakeholder communicator (and human being) I‚Äôve ever met. She will turn any meeting into an enjoyable yet powerful conversation, while asking thoughtful questions to drive success.** Crystal Arteaga: The quiet force on our team who rolls up her sleeves to pitch in on any project regardless of the learning curve. She is sharp, creative, and bright in all her endeavors.** JD Radilla: The biggest content creation genius if I ever saw one (but so humble!). She will turn any intricate and complex information into understandable bite-sized knowledge through great scaffolding and differentiation.** Latoya Burrell: The kindest, most genuine L&D professional. She constantly asks how she can be more helpful, and truly enjoys contributing to the organization as a whole through connecting with its people.** Lauren O'Neill: The smart leader who can manage a team while executing on multiple high-stakes projects at the same time. She encourages and drives others while being solution oriented, kind, and thoughtful for the entire team.** Libby Schofield: The sales guru who has a heart of gold to manage teams authentically and create beautiful content. She genuinely cares and therefore engages learners of all levels through her authenticity.** Marc McCann: The talented coach and leadership developer who was clearly born for this. He will leverage business metrics, his knowledge, and employee experiences to create thoughtful programs that can make greater org/culture impacts.** Michael Franklin, M.S. I/O: The most hard-working, thoughtful trainer with a keen eye on details and knowledge management. He will give his 150% every day to follow through, and to ensure that his learners and stakeholders have exactly what they need.¬†** & Our special guest, Jacqueline Reeves:  the best facilitator I have ever met! She was born to lead and deliver learning programs and Homeward is lucky to have you!To those of you outside of my team who were impacted by the layoffs yesterday - my connections are yours. Please let me know if I can help in any way. Let's continue to live our values #Oneteamonedream #business #team #leadership #layoffs #learning #lookingforajob #openfornewopportunities #opentowork

Dear fellow Indians who have recently gone through the unfortunate #layoffs and are on #h1b,The world seems to be undergoing major unforeseen changes for the past couple of years culminating with the most recent ones with the mass layoffs. I understand the situation is dire, super frustrating, and perhaps even scary. If you'd like to join a company that is revolutionizing BFSI with its digitization solutions and tries to do its best to retain meritocratic talent, send your resumes to talent.acquisition@nucleussoftware.com with the subject line - H1b layoff | Moving back to IndiaMoving back home is not an easy decision, but it is perhaps equally or more frustrating to deal with the uncertainty of #h1bvisain the US. Nucleus Software aims at Making Financial Services Access Easy and Enriching Worldwide and has contributed a lot to making our economy an #aatmanirbharbharat by creating Intellectual Property on Indian Soil for the #BFSI sector. With more than 200 customers in 50 countries, we're continuously pushing boundaries in #techinnovation , #productdevelopment , #projectmanagement, #marketing  and #sales. If you feel like enough is enough, and you want to head back home, remember that there are some very interesting opportunities in our homeland of India waiting for you!

Why do companies lay people off? The best way to answer that question is to use real-world examples from the last 2 weeks. I recorded a video explaining what caused layoffs at these 12 companies:1.

With all the tech layoffs recently, I wanted to share some insights I learned from the recruiting team at my old company that forever changed my own job searches. üí°The team did a 5-year analysis of *all* the candidates who applied through our system (greenhouse) and landed offers. It didn't matter the department (engineering, marketing, finance etc), the 5 yrs of data showed: ‚úÖ Applicants who applied to a job in the first 24-72 hours of it being posted, were 90-95% more likely to land an offer. ‚úÖ 84% of candidates from the 72 hour pool also had an employee referral.‚úÖ The average interview process took about 60 days on the low end, 90 days on the high end. Regardless of department.‚úÖ The peak hiring times of the year were Q1, middle of Q2, and mid to end of Q4.When I asked what they took away from this data, they theorized...On the 24-72 hour window:üê§ 1) Early birds really do get the worm. Managers are excited and more likely to review resumes in the first week because that headcount and budget they fought for last year is finally materializing. Weee!! Sweet relief is on the way. ‚è≥ 2)  Buttt‚Ä¶ they are timed starved, and quickly run out of steam as their "day job" duties  beckon. They move the 72 hour pool forward to keep momentum going and get back to their day jobs. On why employee referrals seem to help:üëØ 1) Simple. The hiring manager already knows their colleagues are smart, kind, and putting their own reputations on the line by referring someone. The candidate already has instant credibility and trust.On the 60-90 days:ü§ù 1) Who a hiring manager brings into the org is a reflection on them. So they'll want to make sure this person can help them scale their own workload [skills], and be a culture fit [chemistry]. üßê2) To do that means the vetting process needs time, and multiple inputs from cross-functional stakeholders/colleagues. Plus, calendars are always a mess (again, day job beckons).üìà On the quarterly trends:1) January/Q1 is the start of most company‚Äôs fiscal new year. The plans they made in the Fall are funded and ready to be executed. They need bodies!2) April/Q2 is ‚Äúbackfill‚Äù season. Roles suddenly open from all the people who left in the new year as part if their ‚Äúnew year, new me, fuck this job‚Äù energy.3) July/Q3 slowdowwwwn. Summer is here! Kids are out of school. Hiring managers are on weeks long PTO. They are also consumed with annual planning. Calendars are a mess.4) Oct/Q4 they need to wrap the year end budgets, and want someone who can onboard and be ready to execute the new annual plan in the new year. I've applied these learnings to my own job searches over the years, I can confirm that every job I've had:+ was one of the first 3 candidates in the running+ had an employee referral+ the process took roughly 9 wks+ I'd interview throughout Q1 or Q2 (60-90 days), and land the offer in Q2 or Q3 (usually around May/June or July)#layoffs #opentowork #jobs #meta #lyft #twitter

Why do people who get to keep their jobs walk out on companies shortly after layoffs?I had dinner with a friend recently, and she told me that her company was forced to lay off 10% of its staff. My friend knew that the aftermath would be challenging, but there was one thing that she and her CEO did not see coming:Resignations from the most talented employees - the people they valued most and wanted to keep at all costs.Yikes!When I asked around, I discovered that it was not an isolated case. Many of the best, most valuable employees seem to leave for greener pastures shortly after layoffs.Why does this happen and what can you do to prevent it?My gut feeling and input from people I spoke with lead me to believe that it‚Äôs not so much because of the layoffs themselves. ùêèùêûùê®ùê©ùê•ùêû ùê•ùêûùêöùêØùêû ùêõùêûùêúùêöùêÆùê¨ùêû ùê®ùêü ùêáùêéùêñ ùê•ùêöùê≤ùê®ùêüùêüùê¨ ùêöùê´ùêû ùê°ùêöùêßùêùùê•ùêûùêù ùêöùêßùêù ùê∞ùê°ùêöùê≠ ùê¢ùê≠ ùê¨ùêöùê≤ùê¨ ùêöùêõùê®ùêÆùê≠ ùêúùê®ùê¶ùê©ùêöùêßùê≤ ùêúùêÆùê•ùê≠ùêÆùê´ùêû.In some cases (see Twitter!), the way the company went about laying people off was the ultimate betrayal of trust and a negation of all the efforts to build a thriving culture.Layoffs are always heartbreaking, but they don‚Äôt need to alienate those who stay. In fact, they can be an opportunity to demonstrate that, even in tough times, you walk the talk and value your people.Here is what I‚Äôm noticing about the companies that handled their layoffs with care and integrity:üß† The Founder or CEO was front and centre. They communicated clearly, with empathy and humility and took accountability for what was going on.üß† The reasons for layoffs were provided, with plenty of context and data available.üß† Severance packages and other vital employee support were as generous as the company could afford and communicated to all staff.üß† There was a forum for conversations, questions and clarifications for anyone who wanted to engage or saught a supportive community.üß† The leaders took time to express how much they valued the contributions of those who lost their jobs, sometimes making a commitment to rehire them when the conditions change. üß† The Founder/CEO presented a clear strategy going forward to help the business bounce back asap.üß† Leaders took time to reassure those who stayed and have a conversation about what the future will look like for them, often carrying out ‚Äústay interviews‚Äù to understand the employees‚Äô concerns and hopes.ùêñùê°ùêöùê≠ ùêöùê´ùêû ùê≤ùê®ùêÆùê´ ùê≠ùê°ùê®ùêÆùê†ùê°ùê≠ùê¨ ùê®ùêß ùê∞ùê°ùê≤ ùê≠ùê°ùêû ùêõùêûùê¨ùê≠ ùêûùê¶ùê©ùê•ùê®ùê≤ùêûùêûùê¨ ùê•ùêûùêöùêØùêû ùê¨ùê°ùê®ùê´ùê≠ùê•ùê≤ ùêöùêüùê≠ùêûùê´ ùê•ùêöùê≤ùê®ùêüùêüùê¨?ùêñùê°ùêöùê≠ ùêöùê´ùêû ùê≠ùê°ùêû ùê≠ùê°ùê¢ùêßùê†ùê¨ ùê≤ùê®ùêÆ‚ÄôùêØùêû ùê¨ùêûùêûùêß ùê∞ùê®ùê´ùê§ ùê≠ùê® ùê¶ùêöùê§ùêû ùê≠ùê°ùêû ùê°ùêûùêöùê´ùê≠ùêõùê´ùêûùêöùê§ùê¢ùêßùê† ùê©ùê´ùê®ùêúùêûùê¨ùê¨ ùê®ùêü ùê•ùêöùê≤ùê¢ùêßùê† ùê©ùêûùê®ùê©ùê•ùêû ùê®ùêüùêü ùê•ùêûùê¨ùê¨ ùêùùêöùê¶ùêöùê†ùê¢ùêßùê† ùêüùê®ùê´ ùêûùê¶ùê©ùê•ùê®ùê≤ùêûùêû ùê¶ùê®ùê´ùêöùê•ùêû ùêöùêßùêù ùêúùê®ùê¶ùê©ùêöùêßùê≤ ùêúùêÆùê•ùê≠ùêÆùê´ùêû?#culturebrained #culture #companyculture #layoffs #peoplefirst #empathy

The atmosphere seems to be getting tenser in the crypto ecosystem following the implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried-founded FTX Derivatives Exchange.

After a little silence about layoffs, Solana-based Non-fungible token (NFT) protocol Metaplex has resumed the trend. The decentralized protocol cited the indirect impact of the FTX collapse as the reason behind the layoff.

Unsolicited #Marketing Musing‚Ñ¢:  There are always multiple ways to solve any #marketing and/or #branding problem you are facing. And as obvious as it sounds the only valuable solutions are the effective ones. However, we are often so caught up in doing something quickly to solve a problem that we are more ineffective in half the time for half the cost. This is not progress. Stop believing that it is. Instead, it's bad business. Very bad business.#metalayoffs #twitter #ftx #ftxcrash #marketingcommunity #marketers #layoffs #recession #opentowork #marketingleadership #branding #staythecourse
