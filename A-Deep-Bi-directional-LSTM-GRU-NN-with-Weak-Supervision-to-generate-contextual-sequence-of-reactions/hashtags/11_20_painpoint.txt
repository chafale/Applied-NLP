Global Challenge (all industries) I play football every week on 3&4G pitches, but my house and car become a rubber playground for weeks and weeks after. Furthermore, I find them in some strange places! who is going to create a solution for this which doesn't involve not playing, leaving your family or changing the surface? I have a group of approx 500 willing to trial a solution. I'm sure there are thousands of others who would also love this and be willing to help.

Sales reps must be trained against “happy ears.”This means interpreting what you want to hear.Which can lead down a road of no decision.There are 2 things you have to ask even if you are receiving positive feedback:1.Are you engaged with the right stakeholders?You may have a champion in the technology department.But if you haven’t reached the top decision makers, your deal can be dead in the water.Individual employees can move on.Or directors can veto plans based on bandwidth.2.Have you identified what problem you’re solving for?Your pitch may translate to the boots on the ground.But have you made a case that speaks to executives.Have you demonstrated the cost of doing nothing versus going with your product/service.That is what motivates people to change their current systems.Optimism can be a great tool in projecting confidence.But you don't want to work on a deal for 5 months only to fail to convert in the redzone.Ask the right questions from day one.And get points on the board. #sales #stakeholders #painpoint

PAIN POINTS OF AFFILIATE MARKETING As an affiliate marketer, you are always looking for ways to improve your campaigns and increase your earnings. However, there are some pain points that can make affiliate marketing challenging, including:1. Low conversion rates: If your conversion rates are low, it means that you are not generating as many sales as you could be. This can be frustrating and can make it difficult to scale your business.2. Tracking issues: Tracking your affiliate links can be tricky. If you don’t have a good system in place, it can be difficult to know which links are performing well and which ones are not. This can lead to wasted time and money.3. Rejection from networks: Getting rejected by affiliate networks can be discouraging. If you are constantly getting rejected, it can be difficult to find a network that is a good fit for your business.4. Payment issues: Getting paid on time can be a challenge for some affiliate marketers.But what are the solutions to this ...

👉🏻 Los puntos de dolor son momentos muy importantes para el colaborador pero en los que siente insatisfacción, porque en la empresa donde trabaja son gestionados significativamente por debajo de sus expectativas. 😰😰⚫️ Por ejemplo, en una compañía la mayoría de los colaboradores expresa que para ellos es muy importante el desarrollo y formación profesional, pero se sienten muy insatisfechos con lo que la empresa les ofrece en ese aspecto. 👉🏻 Esta brecha tan marcada entre la expectativa y la realidad, es la que hace que lo identifiquemos como un PUNTO DE DOLOR en la experiencia de los colaboradores. 😞Una de las maneras más efectivas para identificar los puntos de dolor es realizando encuestas de pulso a todo el personal, o midiendo el Employee Journey Map (Viaje del Colaborador) 😃🧑🏻‍💻Si te interesa leer más al respecto, te invitamos a leer nuestras notas de blog 👉🏻 https://lnkd.in/dpfM8svW#EmployeeExperience #RRHH #Talento #LATAM #Empresas #JourneyMap #PuntoDeDolor #PainPoint

💡 Last week, I discussed style guides and preferences and the processes I work through with clients as part of my role as Managing Editor at nDash. You can find that post here: https://lnkd.in/eTx87iRRThis topic, of course, raised some additional questions – including:😳 What if the brand DOESN’T have a #styleguide to share with #writers or #editors?This problem isn’t uncommon, and as another part of my role as Managing Editor for nDash, I pull that information together. Here’s some of the process I use to draft a basic style guide:➡️ Look at what’s already published on the brand’s siteThis is the easiest place to start, especially if they show you examples of things they’ve published in the past that they either really like or don’t like. (Caveat: If they don’t like any of their content – which happens sometimes – it’s a great opportunity for you to work with them to refine their process and solve that #painpoint.)❓When auditing their content, ask yourself these (and other) questions:📝 Do they use serial commas? 📝 How are the headings formatted? 📝 How many paragraphs do they have in each section before breaking it up with another heading?📝 Can you tell if they follow AP or Chicago style?➡️ Check how they’re handling internal linking, eternal linking, and CTAsSome brands don’t want any links aside from external links to third-party resources validating data, claims/quotes, and statistics. Then, they add one internal link in the CTA pointing to a form fill, product page, contact page, or something like that.❓When examining the brand’s #linkingstrategy, ask yourself these (and other) questions:📝 Do they keep their CTAs at the end of the content below its conclusion?📝 Are CTAs sprinkled throughout the content – like, at the end of the introductory paragraph, somewhere in the middle, or both?📝 Are they anchor-linking to third-party sources or adding them as citations at the end of the content? 📝 Do you see links to other blogs anchored to text, or do they link out to product pages, case studies, data sheets, or other assets?Okay, this post is getting a little (a lot?) long. We haven’t even gotten into voice, tone, and messaging! 💡 Now, over to you – I’d love to hear about your process when you start writing for a brand that doesn’t have a style guide.

David Kolb, USA Learning Theorist said, "Learning is the transformation of experience." I believe this is what makes my workshops so unique in that the participants get to emotionally experience the lesson shifting the learning from the short term memory to the long term memory. As humans we are more likely to recall an emotional experience. By stressing the bodies mentally and physically they experienced how much more difficult it is to FOCUS and so they were focred to consider different strategies of coping until a brake out moment occurred. A big thank you to Brian Quinn of Training Plus Merseyside for ensuring his intakes started their journey with the best possible experience.  #painpointcoach #tpm #workshops #focus

Dear #Recruiters,While I respect the fact that you have a job to do in a very competitive landscape, I do have a lot of issues with the approach most of you have. And to be clear: It's not the fact that you contact me. I'm in sales, I get it. But why on earth do you keep contacting me for roles I have left behind years ago. Can any of you explain to me why you think anyone would think "oh this one has done PM work ages ago, and now clearly has chosen a different path. She will be THE best option"?The example below even made the effort to make it look like they have properly looked at my profile, used my own name AND my mother tongue yet completely ruined it... I can only advise  you to#understandyourcustomer, solve the #painpoint of the candidate AND customer, #relevancy is key I feel like talking to a prospect of my own - and maybe your employers should consider a #CDP. Because how it is going now, you are making a bad name for your complete sector and thus making it harder for all of you to get in contact with that 1 white raven you are looking for.#recruitment #headhunting #customerexperience #360view

Did you know the founder of Calendly had many failed businesses before launching this wildly popular app?One of his failures was an online grill e-tailer. He later admitted “I didn’t even own a grill, I lived in an apartment and had no interest in grilling.”But there was one interest that struck a chord. Time management. Formerly, as a sales rep early in his carrier he noticed the friction and extra communication when booking a meeting with a prospect.So naturally, this was a problem he could emphasize with and went to work solving it.This is an important part of your product/service in business, being able to empathize and relate to your prospective customers.It's exponentially harder solve for a pain point you haven't felt before.It's getting infinitely more difficult to "hack" a certain industry you are not a part of (in which there is "perceived" potential). Why? Because there are already communities and conversations happening and the market can offer immediate feedback.Resonate with your audience, immerse yourself in a community. You will find success there.#community #painpoint #resonate

Product-led customer success is a business strategy that applies product-led principles to customer success or CS functions.Product-led customer success teams put the product at the center of the customer experience and leverage product usage data to guide their strategy.They understand that customer happiness or retention is contingent on delivering exceptional experience across the entire user journey within the context of the product.CS represents the eyes, ears, and heart of a product-led organization with the goal of helping customers find their way to value. A product-led CS strategy requires organizational leaders, and customer success managers to bring a data-driven approach to this mission.They use product analytics to measure customer health, monitor user behaviors, and assess customer sentiment. Then they act on those insights with in-app messaging and guidance as needed. By bringing core CS functions like onboarding and enablement inside the product, CSMs can more easily engage with customers at scale without sacrificing customer service, freeing them to focus on high-value activities to foster deeper customer relationships.A product-led customer success strategy helps CS teams:- Reduce support ticket volumes- Improve long-term product and feature adoption - Predict at-risk accounts- Increase retention and long-term customer loyaltyWhen we look at product-led CS functions, we notice they have a few things in common. Product-led customer success teams:- Share a unified view of customers- Use qualitative and quantitative data- Leverage the product as a communication tool- Use segmentation to personalize their outreach- Support paying customers and freemium users- Shape the future of the productA key historic pain point for CS teams, particularly in large enterprises is that CSMs feel as if they don’t have a say in the product’s future. Product-led CS teams make it a priority to have a seat at the table, using data to understand customer engagement and amplifying customer feedback at scale. They also contribute to the product’s future direction by using the roadmap to have more strategic and informed discussions with their customers creating a continuous loop of feedback that drives product innovation and customer happiness.#plg #customersuccess #onboarding #enablement #painpoint #freemium

I wonder if you can help. ⬆️ This was the subject header of an email I received last week from a female entrepreneur (she's very happy that I'm sharing this, as she feels this can help others in a similar situation).As I started to read her email, It soon became apparent that she was clearly in huge overwhelm and not feeling happy about her current situation.Challenges are showing up with certain team members, she has no time for what she loves to do outside of business, and her energy levels are at an all time low, impacting her mental health and most important relationships.As I continued reading it was very clear to me that burnout is potentially starting to manifest itself, or even worse, has already taken hold.Just by her language and tone of voice, I could tell that she is 100% feeling out of control, and both time and energy poor from the pace of her day-to-day experiences. "I love what I've started, but I'm feeling resentful and guilty that I am missing the important moments in my life and with my family that we will never get back. Last week I did not manage to get home until 9pm every evening, I love bedtime with the kids, but I’m just not there. I seem to always have one eye on work and one eye on whatever else is going on in the business, and I know I'm not being present when I do actually have the time to spend with my family, it’s exhausting. A part of me is saying, walk away, it’s not worth it; my energy and quality time with my loved ones is far more important, but I love what we have built and the potential the business has in the coming years. Help!"I know how this feels as I've been there myself, but I also know there is a happier solution for this client where she can create a much happier, healthier and fulfilling lifestyle, but not from the pace she is currently struggling to operate at.If this resonates with you, please know that you can find a win-win scenario that serves you, your business and your loved ones.#help #overwhelm #burnout #relentless #time #energy #painpoint #mentalhealthawareness #businesswoman #entrepreneurship #coaching #support #mindset #lifestyle #happy #lifebalance #clarity

⚠️ Ihr #PainPoint: #Produktentwicklung kundenspezifischer Aufträge für komplexe oder variantenreiche Produkte effizienter gestalten. Sie kennen bereits die Produktstruktur im #SAP Standard? Guter Ansatz, für Sie ist diese Story jedoch nicht zu Ende erzählt? Dann lohnt sich ein 🔎 Blick auf #SAP #PPG!  #SAP #PPG – Product and Process Governance – erweitert die Produktstruktur mittels virtueller Objekte zu einem digitalen Produktmodell. Über den gesamten #Produktlebenszyklus werden kontinuierlich Daten mit diesem Modell synchronisiert. Ganz im Sinne des #DigitalThread reicht die ⚙️ Verzahnung nicht nur vom #Engineering in die #Fertigung, sondern bis in #Sales, #Projektmanagement und #Service.   Das Ergebnis: Egal ob #MTO & #CTO für variantenreiche Produkte, #CTO+ im Maschinenbau oder #ETO im Anlagenbau – #SAP #PPG optimiert ihre Kundenauftragsprozesse durch #Integration und #Automatisierung. So werden etwa auf Basis des digitalen Produktmodells automatisch nachfolgende Logistikprozesse getriggert.  Ziel ist es alle kundenspezifischen Aufträge mit nur einem digitalen Produktmodell abzubilden.  Das reduziert Kosten in der #Produktentwicklung, erhöht die Flexibilität Ihrer Prozesse und führt in Summe zu mehr Effizienz.   Um das Bild rund zu machen, lässt sich #SAP #PPG ganz leicht in 🔸#SAP #EPD und 🔸#SAP #ECTR integrieren.   Das trifft den Nerv, aber jetzt bitte ins Detail gehen?

FLOW is not about winning or losing. It’s about bringing your best talents to your challenges.In the second round my shoulder dislocated perhaps I should have stopped but in 1980’s we were taught to train through and smile. I am proud of myself because though under constant fire I was hitting back, landing some great kicks and using Ju-Jitsu throws on my opponent several times even before MMA was thought of.Going the distance and doing a further three rounds with arm and two good legs goes to show what resilience is and how it is ingrained in the subconscious through constant practise.#entrepreneur #flow #painpointcoach

#LINKEDIN is lying to me....I wouldn't know what is wrong, but this is the plea of #everydayuser to please stop making me #believe a wrong form of #metric count. My #userjourney is not a pleasant #userexperience when your #system cant understand the number of people in a comment #discussion. I believe its a #painpoint as an everyday user of this platform, so do something about it.If you are just seeing my content, I am mide, the #everydayuser and I would love to meet you. I am #user-#centric in my approach to work so #UIUX design is more of a #lifestyle than a profession to me. I love anything that is visually appealing and functional to the user, so I also am a #professional in #graphic #design.Follow me for more episodes of my journey as both a user and a user centric designer.

Understand your users!  |   Empathize your users!  | Solve their pain points....Ugh.. too many fancy words! right?Let me boil it down for you.We as UX Designers, Design solutions that help consumers/users solve their problems or make their life easier.are you with me?...great.When we are designing! we need to take care of one main thing!That is, to make things easier for users even while using our design!and how do we know if we are making it easy?User testing!but, that is usually done at end of the design draft!What if you can feel the user while designing itself?Though asking simple questions like.If I were a user, would I go this far just to click this one button?Or to anyone on your team.hey! if you are a user, would you download this to know more?This is called empathizing with your user! (empathize- understand and share the feelings of users)While doing this, if you encounter any part of the designs asking you to put more effort!That is a pain point!That's awesome you read the whole thing!Let me know in the comments what you want me to simplify in my next post!Until next time!

Avviare un'impresa è un traguardo importante per molti imprenditori, ma mantenerne una è la vera lotta. Ci sono molte sfide comuni che ogni azienda deve affrontare, siano esse grandi o piccole.Un recente sondaggio ha mostrato che il 91% dei nuovi business sopravvive al primo anno ma solo il 40% rimane in piedi dopo il quinto.Quindi, facciamo un elenco delle principali sfide per ogni imprenditore: Trovare Clienti: difficoltà nell'individuare la giusta nicchia Aumentare la consapevolezza del marchio: mancanza di strategia per costruire una brand identity efficace Lead Generation: uso inadeguato degli strumenti per attrarre potenziali clienti Assumere persone di talento: possono volerci mesi prima che alcuni imprenditori trovino candidati adatti, il che può impedire alle piccole imprese di crescere il più rapidamente possibile. Pianificazione finanziaria: trovare il capitale adeguato da investire Gestione del tempo: troppi compiti collaterali e la necessità di concentrarsi sul core businessTi riconosci in uno dei punti elencati? Starting a business is a significant achievement for many entrepreneurs, but maintaining one is the real struggle. There are many common challenges every business faces, whether they are large or small. A recent survey showed that 91% of new business survive the first year but only 40% will make it until the end of the fifth year.So, let’s make a list of the main challenges for every entrepreneur: Finding Customers: difficulties in identifying the right nicheIncreasing Brand Awareness: lack of strategy to build an effective brand identityLead Generation: inadequate use of tools to attract potential costumersHiring Talented People: it can take months for some business owners to find suitable candidates, which can prevent small businesses from growing as quickly as they could.Financial Planning: to find the financing needed to run and grow the operation can slow down the workflowTime Management: too many collateral tasks and the need to focus on the core businessAre you a business owner struggling with one of these? ✅  #painpoint #challenges #sfide #successo #businessowners #imprese #crescita #startingabusiness #virtualassistant #timemanagement #gestionedeltempo #financialplanning #brandawareness #leadgeneration #assistentevirtuale #servizidisegreteria #serviziit #entrepreneur #imprenditori #ugwebsolution #startup

Tim Cook recently made a good point. We should do a better job of easing the concept of metaverse experiences to people outside the industry. In other words, it is a fundamental user problem to consider when designing Web3 projects, including AR, VR and everything in between.Other than that, it is up to people to decide how long they want to stay digitally immersed—precisely following the same behaviours we have with current devices. The truth is, we are already immersed; we just haven't stamped an industry buzzword for it.#metaverse #web3 #ux #painpoint #onboarding #immersive #spatialcomputing #marketingstrategy

What type of outreach is working best for you right now?I must hear this question 4 or 5 times a day, either in a discovery meeting or someone reaching out to me on LinkedIn. But, unfortunately, I can't give them an answer.What needs to be done next is a problem-centric discovery conversation. First, I have to understand the root cause of this question and what consequences they face from the problem.  At this point, the conversation can go two ways. They tell me what they are experiencing, or they want to hear from me what my SDRs are doing for outreach and not allow me to diagnose what's wrong.It doesn't matter which way they answer the question because it gives me an idea of how much pain they are in. This enables me to develop more qualified leads and forecast more accurately. How do you answer what outreach is working best for you?#develop #painpoint #forecasting

The great #resign, die Explosion an #EPUs und Micro Companies und die Bildung von leistungsstarken Netzwerken fachlich hervorragender Menschen - all das sind Faktoren eines Groundswells, der eines mit sich bringt: Fachkräfte die Experten Ihrer Domains sind, die aber wenig bis keine #Sales Erfahrung haben. Wie gewinne ich einen Kunden? Was schreibe ich in mein Angebot, wie verhandle ich das und wie gestalte ich den Prozeß bis dahin? Fragen über Fragen ...  Diesen #PainPoint kenne ich und er begegnet mir in meinem Umfeld tagtäglich. Daher war ich sofort von der Idee von Along überzeugt als mit Julian Philipp Nagel erstmals davon erzählt hat. Der Claim "align on anything, agree on everything" bringt es perfekt auf den Punkt - Along wird diesen Markt disruptieren: Sales und Business Development wird endlich #smooth. An dieser Stelle auch ein großes Dankeschön an Camilla Sievers die mich mit Julian connected hat und mir somit diese Opportunität eröffnet hat. #Netzwerk #Startups #angelinvestor

"What is a good customer experience?"💡📌 How do you address #customer #painpoint? ➡️ Think outside the box and use it as an advantageLet's talk about IKEA 🪑Memes about the Swedish company went viral for the way they sell their products. If you've been to an Ikea store, you know that you need to take a day off from everything else. You need to invest at least half of your day in shopping in this "labyrinth store". On top of that, you still have to assemble the items you bought at home that come with a manual. (Yes, it's considered a manual)Here is the interesting part. Although it seems counterintuitive, Ikea embraced friction and tension from their #customerjourney. What makes it different is how they address customer pain points. For those who haven't been to any Ikea store, it might as well be considered a theme park for families and adults. The furniture is displayed as it would appear in your home and is particularly appealing to customers. In addition to their #smartdesigns, customers can also use the #mobile app. You can make lists, browse, and check the prices, and availability of your desired products. Moreover, they have a restaurant that serves delicious, but inexpensive meals where kids can also dine. #funfact : "Ikea Place App" uses #AR technology to help users visualize how the products would look in their homes. This decreases the risk of buying objects that don't fit your home.The store wants its customers to experience what most of us aspire to - a peaceful, quiet life, free of stress and anxiety. #cx #cxstrategy #retail #bestpractices #customerexperience

Tüm tasarımlar doğru soruyu sormak ile başlar!Doğru soruyu tasarlamak; tasarımın kendini ortaya çıkarmak için atılması gereken en temel adımdır. Bunu gerektiği gibi tamamlayabilirseniz; bana göre kendinizi #tasarım sürecinin yarısını başarıyla tamamlamış kabul edebilirsiniz.#DesignThinking yaklaşımı özünde doğru soruları sormaya yarayan bir metottur. Derin bir empati ile #persona larınızı tanıyıp, en doğru acı noktayı ( #PainPoint ) tanımlamak ile ilerleyen bir süreçtir. Sonrasında ise, tanımladığınız problemi kullanıcılar üzerinde farklı prototipler ile test ederek gerekli öğrenme çıktılarını elde edersiniz…Tasarım süreci dendiğinde aklımıza onlarca şey gelse de ben Design Thinking yaklaşımı ile ele alınabilecek farklı tasarım türlerinden bahsetmek istiyorum.1. Kullanıcı Deneyimi Tasarımı ( #UXDesign )Ürün ya da servislerinizi geliştirirken kullanıcı beklentilerini, davranışlarını ve ürününüz ile kurdukları etkileşimi doğru anlamak; #sürdürülebilirlik açısından oldukça önemlidir. Süreçlerin farklı boyutlarında çözmeniz gereken problemleri Design Thinking yaklaşımı ile ele alabilirsiniz. İki sürecin DNA’sı neredeyse aynı kodlara sahip…2. Öğrenme Deneyimi TasarımıGeleneksel program merkezli gelişim yaklaşımları yerini öğrenen merkezli yaklaşımlara bırakıyor. Öğrenenin gerçek ihtiyacını anlayarak, sıkıntı yaşadığı noktaları tespit etmekte empati kurma becerilerimizin yüksek olması gerekiyor. Sonrasında ise doğru öğrenme deneyimini sunarak yetkinlik geliştirmek mümkün.3. Endüstriyel Ürün TasarımıBaşlı başına #empati , fikir geliştirme ve #prototip leme süreçleri ile dolu bir yolculuk! İşin #müşteri, #üretim, #pazarlama ve daha birçok aşamasında, yüksek belirsizlik koşullarında problem çözme becerilerinin belirleyici olduğu bir süreç için Design Thinking, ekipteki tasarımcı olmayan üyelerin de bu şekilde düşünmeleri için doğru yöntemi sunacaktır.4. Çalışan Deneyimi Tasarımıİşin odağında insan olduğu sürece Design Thinking doğru çözümlere ulaşmada anahtar rol oynayacaktır.

Attended an interesting panel discussion yesterday on the rise and challenges of plant-based food ingredients for alternate protein segment at Hi-Fi #Expo, #BIEC, #Bangalore. #HiFi It has taken us 3+ years to understand this sector from macro level and first of all, why it should exist in India? Should it exist in India on the pretext of mainly being cruelty-free and sustainability? Should it exist in India on the pretext that 40%+ Indians (Rural & Urban) are protein deficient? Are the innovators and investors missing out a great opportunity today? Who will win - consumers, startups, farmers, MNCs, Angel investors, B2C, B2B, Ingredient supplier, Venture captalist, PE funds, government or maybe someone else? However, if you flip this question a bit…then ‘who will definitely not win’ in a longer run?Will the conventional protein companies just hold on to their existing beliefs and keep on ignoring this most-happening sunrise sector? Taking a corollary example, 70%+ people of West Bengal are lactose intolerant but maybe 99% of people there still drink milk 🥛. Is it so easy to just pour in money 💰 and consumers will their food habits or will the consumers suddenly wake up from their slumber one day and adopt unconventional proteins? Let’s get real…it’s not going to happen. From taste point of view, this is the right-time-right-place for consumers in India. They are going to be served with the best tasting alternative protein in few years time. And it may increase #consumerism. But “ultimately who will win”…only time will tell.#UnconventionalProtein #GimmickOrReal #PainPoint #ConsumerThyKing #KingNeedNotUnderstandAlternateProtein #AltProtein #AlternateProtein

💯 Avviare un'impresa è un traguardo importante per molti imprenditori, ma mantenerne una è la vera lotta. Ci sono molte sfide comuni che ogni azienda deve affrontare, siano esse grandi o piccole.🔺Un recente sondaggio ha mostrato che il 91% dei nuovi business sopravvive al primo anno ma solo il 40% rimane in piedi dopo il quinto.Quindi, facciamo un elenco delle principali sfide per ogni imprenditore:📌 Trovare Clienti: difficoltà nell'individuare la giusta nicchia📌 Aumentare la consapevolezza del marchio: mancanza di strategia per costruire una brand identity efficace📌 Lead Generation: uso inadeguato degli strumenti per attrarre potenziali clienti📌 Assumere persone di talento: possono volerci mesi prima che alcuni imprenditori trovino candidati adatti, il che può impedire alle piccole imprese di crescere il più rapidamente possibile.📌 Pianificazione finanziaria: trovare il capitale adeguato da investire📌 Gestione del tempo: troppi compiti collaterali e la necessità di concentrarsi sul core businessTi riconosci in uno dei punti elencati? ✅ 👇📧info@ugwebsolution.com☎www.ugwebsolution.com#painpoint #challenges #sfide #successo #businessowners #imprese #crescita #startingabusiness #virtualassistant #timemanagement #gestionedeltempo #financialplanning #brandawareness #leadgeneration #assistentevirtuale #servizidisegreteria #serviziit #entrepreneur #imprenditori #ugwebsolution #startup

Day 28 - Pain Points 😑They are negative experiences a user faces in different aspects of the product. It can be on different levels : 1. Financial : Youtube premium ads, Spotify premium ads...... yeah those. Pain points related to money, the user experience getting hurdled by a payment screen.2. Product : Product pain points are issues with a product or service which consistently inconvenience users. A very famous example is push-pull doors, even the push/pull sign fails at times 😭.3. Process : These are pain points related to navigation, getting from point A to B in a product. Features that aren’t self explanatory can be confusing for the user on how to use, might as well get them to exit. 4. Support : Support pain points are from users feeling an bad support when using a product. An example of this kind of pain point is when a user is navigating a website or web service, runs into trouble, and is unable to locate a customer service contact point. This can affect the relationship of the user with the product.Done with 28 posts only, 92 days more to. We looked at more UX processes this week, we will be looking at UIs next week.

I get my best ideas while walking ...And today, my mind just could not stop bubbling with the ideas during the walk.Why?Because, I was listening to Grow and Convert's video titled "Blog Content Strategy: What Content Should You Produce to Generate Leads?" during an hour long walk.It's gold!Here are some key takeaways:1. When you are just getting started with content marketing, choose keywords that show searcher's interest in buying your product/service. e.g. "Best e-commerce fulfilment service companies"2. If it's difficult to come in top results for the selected keyword on Google try to narrow it down with the unique differentiation you offer.e.g. "Best e-commerce fulfilment service for startups" or "low volume pick and pack service at affordable price"3. Share your disruption story - where most other companies fail and how your product/service uniquely solves that problem.e.g. "Most content marketing agencies fail to bring leads for their clients here is what we do differently ..... "4. Share case studies or customer success stories tied with the pain points you solve in a way that when your ideal customer is looking for product/service like yours on google - you can show your proven track record and win customers.5. Write well researched in-depth content.6. Don’t shy away from putting your best sales pitch out there in the content.You are bound to get leads from your content marketing efforts!#internalchatter #contentmarketing #contentstrategy #startups #google #seo #blogs P.S.

Do you find it difficult to get #reviews for your business?Two years ago, when I was looking for a daycare for my child, I searched Google to find preschools near me.Went through reviews, ratings, and recommendations to shortlist a couple of daycares.Personally visited to select one.If you see, reviews play an important role. Reviews helped me narrow down from eight to three.Recently, when I was asked to write a review for the school, I was quite happy to do so.Here is what I really loved about the request email:1. Subject line - requesting appreciation2. Excellent timing - #Teachersday when parents/kids usually express gratitude in the form of cards or tiny gifts3. Email copy - Very well written - making receivers feel valued4. Email closing - expressing gratitude - driving a positive responseYour thoughts?#internalchatter#contentmarketingP.S.

The second post in my How I use Fellow as CSM series is all about Tags! #️⃣Taking detailed notes during customer calls is crucial to helping me remember what was discussed, any tasks I’ll have to complete, and insights to share. But these notes can become long and take time to digest what needs immediate action and what needs to be done. To help save me time I use tags in Fellow to help me categorize my notes.Some of my most common tags I use in Fellow are:#featurerequest#insight#followup#submitted#customerlove#painpoint#submittedThese tags help me review my meeting notes afterwards and quickly give me direction on features I need to submit to our product team, customer insights to share in our Slack channels, and even what resources or information I told the customer I’d follow up on.One of my rituals is that every Friday I review all my #featurerequest tags from the week to make sure I have #submitted them. One of my best practices: once I have shared the #featurerequest or #insight internally, I add the #submitted tag so that I know it has been done. This helps me stay accountable to my customers!! 💪🏻How do you stay accountable with all things that come out of your customer calls? Share in the comments below! 👇🏻⏭ Next week I’ll be showcasing how I leverage our CRM integration so communication doesn’t remain siloed!

Connais tu la "functional food"? 🏃‍♂️As-tu déjà dû prendre plus de Protéines, plus de Vitamine C, plus de Fer? 🥕

J'ai découvert ces boîtes de thon enrichi en Fer, Vitamine C, L-Carnitine etc... 
Elles s'adressent aux sportifs qui cherchent à accorder leur alimentation avec leur pratique sportive. 🚴‍♀️ 🏃‍♀️ 🏋️‍♀️

On trouve beaucoup ces produits outre-atlantique, surtout sur l'apport supplémentaire en protéines. Mais personne ou presque en Europe. 🇺🇸🇪🇺

On assiste à la création de marques lifestyle qui reproduisent même les shakers post-séance de musculation comme les skakes protéinés de Chobani, Drink Pirq ou FOGA.

#Doctors’ digital #dissatisfaction with #pharmacompanies has jumped during the #pandemic. Across media channels, dissatisfaction rates ranged from 23% to almost 50% of #physicians who were unhappy with #pharma #digital's #interactions, according to recent research by #pharma and #healthcare #consultancy Indegene. #Socialmedia is a particular #painpoint, with 49% of physicians not happy with those engagements. One of the problems there could be the #less #sophisticated #pharma engagement, especially when compared to expectations set by consumer companies.#Physicians expect the same level of #seamless experience and customer service as when shopping online on Amazon or streaming entertainment on services like Netflix, Gaurav Kapoor, Indegene executive VP, said.

My two cents to my friend ...********After reading this post tell me a "Yay" or a "Nay" if I am a natural at #marketing *********One of my friends is resuming her career after 10 good years of maternity break.The other day while we were walking she told she is looking for someone in #compensationandbenefits who can guide her a little in acing the course she recently began.I personally don't know anyone in compensation and benefits, however, because I know she began the course to land a #job.Here are the two cents I gave to her:1. Create a strong LinkedIn profile, it's a great place to be found for a job2. Follow all people in #Singapore who are in #compensationandbenefits 3. Message a few to request #mentorship, having a mentor speeds up your growth like nothing else.4. Connect with Singapore based recruiters5. Tell them you would be ready soon for the job, ask them how you can make yourself a strong candidate for the job6. During your course keep sharing your learnings on LinkedIn7. Post regularly, use #opentowork along with other field related hashtagsI feel these tiny suggestions can surely help her #market #herself and land a job real quick!*********Now tell me ...1. Am I a natural at marketing?2. Do you know someone in #compensationandbenefits who will be ready to mentor my dear friend?3.

A perennial eCommerce payment #painpoint: Being billed by startups in USD ...Simply billing businesses from overseas (even in AUD) on our credit cards increases our costs by 3% - that's just the foreign transaction fee.If billing in USD (or any other foreign currency), we then have to pay the eye watering retail FX spreads banks build into their exchange rate.Margins are already thin in eCommerce and this dilutes any savings the startup professes to deliverFor major expenses like shipping / 3PL - this adds up - grows as we scale - and will ultimately become the catalyst for switching providers...So, if your startup is all about helping small businesses in Australia succeed in eCommerce, consider setting up your ops to support local billing, in local currency.Businesses in other countries will no doubt appreciate the gesture too.Shout out if anyone knows a shipping aggregators that bill locally (and ideally integrate with Aussie Post and Wix). Home grown startups in the space, sadly, no longer do ... #payments #eCommerce

"Okay...Ok I'm frustrated." I blurted this out without thinking yesterday in a meeting with a new coworker. 😳 I braced myself, internally, for their response. Historically, I am a conflict-avoidant person. I believed that conflict in the #workplace needed to be avoided at all costs. Side Note: More and more I am convinced that our desire to avoid conflict in the workplace is crippling innovation and healthy #workplaceculture.  Back to the tense conversation…😬 “Ok I am frustrated and clearly so are you. Tell me what specifically is it that is frustrating you about this.”  We were discussing solutions to a process that would help us automate a #painpoint. I was pushing ahead just looking for the solution and felt like my coworker was trying to be a roadblock. I was wrong. My coworker was pumping the breaks and probably felt like I was not considering their very real and legitimate concerns.  After they expressed their concerns it allowed us to come to a solution that was better than either of us had hoped! We reflected together on how we wouldn't have arrived at that conclusion if we had passive-aggressively chosen not to talk about our frustrations. GO, TEAM!  If you avoid conflict at work you are crippling your #productivity, your ability to #innovate, and your #career. Time and time again studies have shown that a key component of building #innovativeecosystems is psychological safety. You can’t have psychological safety if you can't express your emotions, most especially the unpleasant ones.  #innovation #workculture #worklife #team #work

Lay-Offs! A great #challenge.30 days to find and start a new position. Can it be done? This is going to be an interesting journey. There surely are not a lack of positions open, but the question falls to - time. ⏰ Time to tailor every #resume  at 30 - 60 mins⏰ Time to pass the ATS (if it passes)⏰ Time to have a human review⏰ Time to schedule the #interview ⏰ Time to have the follow on #interviews (Horror stories I am reading are 7, YES SEVEN, rounds or more)but each ⏰ ticking moment is one moment closer to the #dreamjob - my dreamjob is one where I can make a difference. Where I can make the load a little lighter on my #team, help ease the frustration or burden or #painpoint of the #customer. I need to work and know I am making a difference.Can I do this? Yes.Do I need help? Abso-fricken-lutely - Internal referrals, knowing someone who knows someone, opening doors - all appreciated. I can't do this alone.

Before I reached this point to where I am right now, I'm just like you who made mistakes (and will still make mistakes in the future) when I was starting my business.I was a Business Graduate and had my Master's Degree in Organizational Leadership and yet I went through a lot—a roller coaster ride of what business actually looks like.Here are the top 4 mistakes I made when starting:1. Not being decisive-I was afraid of making a wrong decision.2. Spending too much time on things that didn’t matter- want to know what matters when starting a business? It’s not the perfect website.3. Not being clear on who I served-you can niche to an industry or problem. But I wasn’t even clear on who I served.4. Not believing in myself-my business shifted when I started believing in myself and how I could help business owners transform from mediocre to great CEOs.Starting a business is hard, but growing it is a lot harder. As Coco Channel quoted “Success is often achieved by those who don't know that failure is inevitable."Yes you can reach that success, but be humble enough to learn from your previous mistakes, future mistakes you are going to make, and advices from an Expert.Need a piece of advice from a Business Strategist?

Burnout in attorneys in the legal profession Complaints like boredom, work-life balance, and assignment of terrible cases are common among mid-level associates experiencing burnout at their workplaces. Despite the burnout, many employees choose to stay due to good pay. Today, more and more law companies are questioning the merits of a system that heavily encourages burnout, despair, and anxiety. Poor work-life balance, monotony, exhaustion, boredom, a lack of recognition, and a variety of other factors contribute to employee burnout. This paper discusses the measures companies can adopt to create a healthy work environment:  • Listening to employees • Recognizing pain points in the system • Hiring an attorney professional development expert Read the full paper here -> https://lnkd.in/dgmrEc3G or visit https://lnkd.in/dZGBtV6y to know more. #burnout #worklifebalance #employeewellbeing #painpoint #lawfirms #GreenPointLawandCompliance #eDiscovery #lawfirms #documentreview

We hear it again and again. Problems with reports!Reports are crucial when you use data to make informed decisions. And so many times, getting the reports causes major problems for companies. 👉The reports time out👉They take a long time to run👉The data is not always accurateGenerating reports is a two-step process:✅Massaging the data✅Using the data to create the reportThe issue is that both parts are using the same database. This makes the process very heavy and it can slow down the entire system. Companies come to us with these issues of slow and inaccurate reports. Our solution: 👉Two mirrored databases - one for crunching the data, and one for generating the report. When the data is ready in database 1, it’s mirrored in database 2, which is read-only. The implementation of this solution is not always simple, but the idea is, and we’ve used it to help many clients address their problems with reports. Follow #CiderConsulting for great info on systems, software, and business#PainPoint #Report#Systems

The workforce has changed and will continue to change.  Organizations need to be flexible with the never-ending changes in the external environment (think about everything you can't change, that is the external environment). From new technology to new laws, to new expectations, the way that workers approach the workplace has changed.  They care less about the paycheck and more about how the job helps fulfill a purpose. They care less about an annual review and want an ongoing conversation about their job performance. They want to focus on what they do well and how it incorporates into the workplace. As a leader, when you can tap into this new generation and expectations for the new workforce, you will unlock higher productivity and potential than ever before.Source: @gallup.....#business #businessconsultant #businessdevelopment #businessmindset #coach #leadership #painpoint #improve #selfawareness #mindfulness #entrepreneurship #inspiration #continuallearning #reskilling #upskilling #development #professionaldevelopment #womeninbusiness #mentorship #possibilities #leadershipdevelopment #leadershipskills #leadershipcoach #leadershiptips

What do I do as a Business Consultant? 🤔💭Being a Business Consultant is sometimes like a marriage counselor between the business owner and the business/their team. As an outsider, I’m able to ask the necessary questions that need to be asked, without the repercussions. And I absolutely love being able to help my clients. However, some days go super smooth, we work on the planned agenda, and on other days, we pivot and work on what is the most pressing issue for the client.When things come up in your business, we take a look at what the problem is. Is it around a process? Is it around a person? Then we brainstorm ways to move forward in navigating that problem.You see, everything is connected in an organization. Your strategy should be developed using processes, people, and technology. Issues will always arise. It is discovering where the roadblock is, and developing a plan forward. Do you know what is stopping you from making progress in your business? Click the link below for your first steps assessment. We will diagnose your business to see what first steps you can take to put a plan into action for your business.https://lnkd.in/g5zbMhxx......#business #businessconsultant #businessdevelopment #businessstartup #businessgoals #entrepreneurlife #entrepreneurmindset #engage #improve #messaging #narketingstrategies #smallbusiness #bossladymindset #bossmom #painpoint #businessmindset #californiabusiness #losangelesbusinessowner #fresno #559

One of the significant pitfalls for all entrepreneurs and executives is that they assume they know their potential customers and skip talking to them and gathering data. Recently, I was amazed to watch seasoned executives at CNN make this mistake. They spent $300 million to set up CNN+, but they did not do the necessary due diligence to gauge their viewers about the concept of CNN+, and their streamlining business failed. This well-known worldwide brand's new business could only attract about 10.000 viewers daily, and Chris Licht, the latest CNN CEO, nixed the venture after a month.#customerexperience #painpoint #solutions #brand #thewhy #customerfeedback

I really admire product designers and marketers.Look what they do to a simple toothbrush..!They find out painpoints of users, design an appropriate solution and then with right communication they inform their target audience.Several decades ago the USP was just rounded bristles and today the options are amazing. Including sharper bristles !And by doing so, they take everyone up the value chain and what could be sold for a paltry amount now fetches several times more. And the customer happily pays for it.It is all about finding the right painpoints and addressing it appropriately.If you are running a small or mid-size business, how are you creating value for your customers and yourself? If you are just following the herd then it is time to talk to me..! We could brainstorm and address that issue.

#RandomthoughtThe EARLIER you identify a symptom of a disease or an undesirable situation in your body, better are the chances of avoiding much damage to your body.Similarly, the earlier you identify and realise a pain point  in your customer journey or in your life , better are the chances of negotiating it which makes identifying pain and going after it and throwing it out of the sight a better option than identifying it after a considerable damage is done. So, keep an eye on what's giving you pain and what's keeping your business or life limited." Why ?/ Reason " is a great leader. Once you identify an undesirable situation, REASON will lead you better than anything.If knowledge leads to GLORY, Negligence leads to CHAOS. Needless to say , we know the consequences of neglecting a symptom or a pain point. #Painpoint #Customer #Challenge #Solution#Business #Startup #Technology #Company

Wir bevorzugen eine offene Zusammenarbeit auf Vertrauensbasis und Augenhöhe. Es stellt also sogar einen gewissen Filter für potenziellen Kunde*in da, die unsere Werte nicht teilen.Was für Goodies habt ihr in euren Angeboten?#businessdevelopment #offers #fromgoodtogreat

I PAIN POINTSI punti dolenti, o pain point, sono problemi reali che il tuo pubblico o i tuoi consumatori stanno vivendo. Questi problemi si concretizzano principalmente attraverso le lamentele, i tassi di abbandono rispetto al tuo e-commerce, oppure la semplice e banale frustrazione di non avere abbastanza informazioni per procedere con l’acquisto sul tuo sito.Lo studio che riguarda i pain point è molto ampio, tanto da coinvolgere attivamente enti di ricerca, come la Consumer Federation of America, che ogni anno si impegna a indagare su quali possano essere i principali punti di dolore dei consumatori, attraverso indagini e interviste. In base ai dati degli ultimi anni, uno dei principali fattori che per gli utenti assume toni negativi, costituendo un punto di dolore, è la comunicazione fuorviante. Il pubblico si sente ingannato dalle pubblicità che non sono veritiere, oppure dalle informazioni nascoste. O ancora, è il senso di abbandono quando, di fronte ad una disperata richiesta di aiuto, l’azienda sparisce, lasciando il cliente tra dubbi irrisolti.  #commerce #comunicazione #painpoint

PERFECTIONISM- No. Nein. Näo.If innovators would wait for the perfect time, no innovation would take place. And if they attempted to overcome all possible objections before even taking the first step, they would never start.Chasing perfection in this digitally transformative world is the bottleneck to progress, reminds Divya Kaushal.In our weekly catchup, Divya mentioned how often she hears entrepreneurs holding themselves waiting for the right time, the right resources , the right business plan and the right everything- only to forever be waiting.Businesses should thoroughly understand the customer #painpoint it wishes to address and then get methodical about achieving that goal. That's it- the 2-step recipe to digital success.#thoughtleadership #thoughtoftheweek

Un buen vendedor, debe estar preparado para vender en cualquier momento, las buenas oportunidades se presentan cuando menos te lo esperas, por eso un buen "Pitch de Ventas" debe ser considerado como una herramienta de alto valor. Saber que decir y conectar con tu prospecto, equivale a qué se abra la puerta o no. Para construir un "Pitch" efectivo requieres saber 3 hacks importantes:1. ¿Que solucionas?2. ¿Qué emoción genera en tu prospecto, el tener un problema, deseo o dolor?3. ¿Si tu prospecto no  lo resuelve, que pasaría?Recuerda que si no hay dolor, no hay venta.

When I think about scalable Advanced Air Mobility I don't think of eVTOL uber-taxis or luxury personal transportation. I think of this.argodesign 's concept for a drone ambulance. Especially in urban environment, fast responders have difficulty navigating through traffic-jammed roads to access crash sites.According to argodesign an estimated 1,000 "saveable" lives are lost a year because of slow emergency response in the US biggest cities alone.It’s designed to land almost anywhere, thanks to a footprint the size of a compact car. The emergency responders stabilize the patient, load him/her up, and return back to the hospital for further treatment. “It would be nice to see them used this way, rather than another military function or more photography.” - said CEO Mark Rolston The idea was born from a team brainstorming session around how health care could become more accessible.The designers first thought about how they could build a better ambulance, and the rise of autonomous vehicles inspired them to consider a self-driving ambulance. Then they thought of helicopters and drones, and the rest developed from there.There’s also the issue of price: Rolston believes an ultralight drone could be constructed in the million dollar range.That's several times more expensive than a wheeled ambulance, but still cheaper than a medical helicopter.#DronesForGood #Concept #Drones #UAM #AAM #AirMobility #Uspace #DroneAmbulance #Technology #Innovation #PainPoint #Medevac

Pain point: Devoir renvoyer des articles achetés en ligne 📦Vous achetez un pantalon en ligne. Facile. 😁
Il ne vous va pas. Vous devez le remballer, imprimer une etiquette et le réexpedier. Et vous n'avez même pas de pantalon. Pénible. 😠

Pourrions-nous imaginer un service d'essayage à domicile? 🤔

Vous commandez en ligne. Vous recevez vos pantalons. Vous avez 24h pour essayer dans le confort de votre chez vous. 🏠Puis, un livreur vient récuperer ce que vous ne gardez pas. 🚲
Tout ça gratuitement. Séduit(e)?

C'est un service rapide à mettre en place pour les boutiques des grandes villes. Grace à un pack de service logistique + SaaS de gestion des articles en essayage. 📊

Pour la boutique c'est augmenter son affluence et proposer un service différenciant. Pour la DNVB @Ayr Jeans: "75 % des acheteurs qui ont fini par faire un achat après avoir testé le jean chez eux sont des nouveaux clients"

L'essai à domicile existe chez Ace & Tate, Amazon Wardrobe et Stitch Fix par exemple. Mais le retour n'est jamais pris en charge.

Qu'en pensez-vous? Ce pain point existe-t-il ? Merite-t-il d'être abordé?

Le marché de l'essayage à domicile est une opportunité pour des acteurs comme Experienced Capital, Eurazeo, L Catterton, Lyra Ventures, Eutopia, Heartcore Capital , Alven Christelle Lécuyer-Weber François Meteyer Louis-Kentaro Danjou Claude Amielh Kenza Zayani Yacine Ghalim Alizée Natali Marion Combette #painpoint #market #businessmodel #business #solution #service #fashion #opportunité

Being in Flow brings you satisfaction, and feelings of elation and enriches your creativity. It's about being completely immersed in your life as you live it.We know as humans that to achieve what we truly want, especially in the workspace, we need purpose and passion, albeit in a balanced measure. But how do we find that perfect balance between purpose and passion that connects us to our Flow? Practice.Hear me out… I often talk about the happiest people being the ones who spend more time than others in a state of Flow. That for me defines success.Flow is very much in the experience and that’s how I translate what is traditionally a theoretical subject. And once you’ve experienced it, it feels immense, yet you feel calm in your concentration and focus. Being in Flow is about being in the moment, a feeling you will have mastered if you meditate and practice mindfulness.  Some say it’s like learning to swim or driving a car. It takes patience and practice. The more you practice the less effort you'll need. The less effort, the more naturally you fall in tune with your Flow.#flow #coordination #control #empowerment #painpointcoach

“A problem well stated is a problem half-solved” - Charles KetteringNothing can describe #uxwriting better than this! Given the low average attention spans, capturing and holding visitors' attention is a challenging task. Examine a bit more and you’ll see it is essentially about presenting and highlighting the #painpoint as simply as possible. Customers should be able to relate to the issue being addressed the moment they read your copy. Expert tip: When it comes to UX writing, follow the three Cs of Clarity, Consistency, and Conciseness in your design to reduce ambiguity. The weighted importance of crisp writing cannot be understated when measured against other #uxdesignprinciples (curious about other principles? take a look at the comment with this post)

Will Cannon is a serial #entrepreneur with proven repeat success. He's the founder of UpLead and Signaturely, both of which he grew to success with adoption from mega-companies such as Google , Amazon , Microsoft , and Dropbox. He recently sat down with SaaS Mag to share his journey and offer advice to other entrepreneurs grinding their way to success. Here are 11 takeaways:   1) An early start:  🔘 Will’s founder journey began at 19 when he launched a real estate company. Next, he then started a B2B marketing agency focused on customer acquisition.  2) First #painpoint 🔘 Smaller companies wanted high-quality leads that were often out of their price range.  🔘 Verifying email lists required costly manpower, so Will decided to create an affordable solution. He hired a team to develop a tool that could automate the process.  3) Second pain point 🔘 When signing documents, he felt the available e-signature platforms were too complex.  🔘 Will hired developers to create an unfussy solution that allows users to easily upload documents and sign them.  4) Ideal customer 🔘 #UpLead and #Signaturely focus on creating valuable but affordable solutions for small- and medium-sized businesses.5) Product-market fit 🔘 Customers quickly adopted UpLead and Signaturely because they were developed from an existing market gap.  6) Grow from an MVP 🔘 Will recommends that you release your products as soon as you have a minimum viable product to attain potentially game-changing feedback early on. 7) Competitor feedback 🔘 Will and his team researched competitors and implemented changes based on their findings.  🔘 Look for features that could improve your product, such as a smooth onboarding process, setup wizard, or added benefits.  8) Look at reviews 🔘 Will and his team looked at competitors' negative reviews, found the dissatisfied individuals on LinkedIn, and encouraged them to try their product. It worked.  9) Diversified CACs 🔘 A single algorithm change can knock a business from page one into oblivion--taking all viable customers with it.  🔘 To avoid that, Will recommends diversifying your traffic sources and adds, "At the end of the day, you want most of your customers to come to you from word of mouth." 10) Scale your business 🔘 Test anything related to your company and its operation, such as products, pricing, and landing pages.  🔘 Make a few minor improvements at a time, such as conversion rate optimization and performing one-week tests for various adjustments.  11) Hire the right people 🔘 Take time to hire the right employees, especially if you’re building a big business.

Actually *defining* a problem can be such a difficult task.And yet it is crucial to the design thinking process.If you can’t define the problem, then you won’t be able to design a solution.Think of the process being like a road trip.  You usually have an end destination in mind.However, the journey can go in all sorts of directions and take plenty of pit stops along the way.But in the end, you still want to get to your final destination.Same with design thinking.Creativity is never a linear process.  But that doesn’t mean we start without an end goal in mind.So before we do anything, we define the problem.And that means first identifying your user - who is experiencing this problem (or pain point)?Alright, so now you have your user.  What do they need to solve?  Think of using this sentence frame:  _____(User)_____ needs a way to _____(Verb)_____ because _____(Why is this a problem?)____.Phew! You did it!  (Psst!

L’empathie est d’une puissance remarquable Elle est une qualité essentielle qui est d’ailleurs à la base du #DesignThinkingJe voulais vous partager cette façon de penser car ça peut s’appliquer à votre business, vos projets, vos équipes et même votre vie personnelle. Lorsque nous rencontrons quelqu’un pour la première fois nous pouvons avoir beaucoup d’hypothèses sur sa personnalité. Mais en apprenant à la connaître, nous pouvons découvrir que nos suppositions n’étaient pas si exactes.Nous pouvons penser que nous savons qui est notre utilisateur, notre client mais la recherche en UX avec l’empathie révèle qui il est vraiment et ce dont il a réellement besoin, ça nous permet de créer un produit qui répond à un réel besoin… Je vous partagerai dans un autre post quelques techniques utilisées en #uxdesign #uxdesign #designthinking #uxresearch #empathy #empathie #rechercheutilisateur #painpoint #marketingdigital #digitalstrategy #uxstrategy #uxtraining #personas #customerjourney #customerjourneymapping

Mobile insurance policies are good on paper only.You buy a phone costing upwards of Rs. 20000 ($280+) via Amazon.You get Acko (or other) mobile insurance product offered as cross sale.Since its a low cost add on (Rs. 500-1000), you tend to buy fearing the worst (screen damage, liquid spill etc.)You feel good that your phone is secured.Until it really happens.That's when you realize that insurance you purchased is a pain in itself.Your request to fix the phone will take anywhere between 7-20 days and that too after multiple calls.No guarantee that it will be fixed to your satisfaction.Majority of the cases, only 1 time repair is possible in a year.A big market opportunity for insurance providers to solve this post purchase user journey.I am sure companies like Ditto will be keeping an eye on this and emerge as a leader in this segment.#opportunity #amazon #leader #insurance #user #painpoint #productmanagement

"Da piccole parole, derivano grandi responsabilità"Forse lo zio Ben di Spiderman non diceva così, però scommetto che se avesse studiato #copywriting, avrebbe rielaborato la sua frase cult in questo modo.E avrebbe avuto ragione, perché quelle piccole parole chiamate #microcopy hanno davvero un potere enorme.Quando si lavora su un'app il principale pain di un copywriter è quello di avere letteralmente poco spazio: tutto deve essere perfettamente fruibile dal piccolo schermo. Quelle grandi idee che sembrano geniali in una ventina di caratteri (che non sono molti) vanno spesso ridotte a poche manciate di parole. Ah... devono ovviamente continuare ad essere geniali.E quindi come si fa?  Un grande aiuto è quello di analizzare e comprendere a fondo ad un #painpoint.Non è un nuovo programma di Microsoft (anche se il nome lo suggerirebbe), ma sono i problemi che gli utenti hanno e che il prodotto/ servizio/ app per cui scriviamo si propone di risolvere.Conoscendo il pain point è possibile elaborare un microcopy efficace. Con questo infatti rispondiamo ad un problema dell'utente con poche parole rassicuranti, così come fosse un amico al telefono.Lavorando in quest'ottica diventa molto più facile elaborare microcopy efficienti.Per capire di più sui pain point e come gestirli con le parole nei diversi touchpoint con gli utenti, consiglio questo articolo di Pennamontata.

Focus on getting Love from Clients not Likes from Fans.Social Media will have us believing the only way to be "successful" is to dominate every social platform and "build your following" on each.  As a result, we have grown folks trying to learn TikTok dances, inexperienced young "ceo's" giving "expert" business advice, and too many people trying to pretend to know everything about everything.But why? For social clout? The question we have to ask ourselves is...does this convert? I spent years doing what all the "experts" said I had to do, posting 10 million times a day on all platforms.  But when I stepped back and asked myself that simple question...my path to clients got clearer, the results came more frequently, and more importantly my TIME came back.Find what moves the needle forward for your career or company, and stick with that.  You don't need trends, or dances, you simply need to position yourself in front of clients who's pain point you can solve.#selfleadership #socialmedia #painpoint

Can you guess which bank it is from the colours in the design? Straight from my old repository, one of the initial designs for a bank applications. The idea was simple: "Understanding the user pain-points with from the existing application and addressing them".For this bank, the main concern was the visual design, lack of analytics and the unresponsive interface. I made an attempt to make it a little better, if not perfect.

End to sending mails with no attachment.How many times, it happens that you forget to attach mail and then the recipient will send a mail asking for attachment.This is a pain point which is small but very much real.A good example of user experience offered by Gmail which asks you to check if you forgot the attachment (or not).These small UX fixes define the overall experience of a great product.#productmanagement #ui #ux #design #customer #painpoint

Pop quiz! What basic human item is missing in almost every hotel bathroom? Scroll for the big reveal!! …..  ….. Yup, it’s tampons. Travel is resuming. The odds of a person who menstruates needing a tampon (or other period supply) on a business trip is around 1 out of every 5 trips. If that’s not enough of a business case, imagine the following: - Your guest discovers they need a tampon and calls the front desk.- Guest (considers options, takes a moment, gathers courage, picks up the phone). “Hi there, I’d like some tampons sent to my room please.” - Front of house staff, “Can you please send some what?”- Guest repeats (starting to get embarrassed), “Some tampons. Please.”How does this conversation go from there? How might it go right? How might it go wrong? And why does this conversation even need to happen in the first place? At Throughline, we look for outlier experiences and pain points grounded in real human stories and experiences to fuel innovation in the healthcare ecosystem. We uncover the assumptions that may no longer (or never!) have been true and may be limiting opportunities to innovate. While the hotel industry is not our usual domain, the same rules apply. Products to support people who menstruate should be one of the ‘hotel bathroom basics’ alongside the shampoo, conditioner, hand cream, soap, robe, toilet paper, towels and the random lavender scent stick. Why aren’t they there in the first place? Uncertain - but it's never too late to change! #inclusivity #designthinking #innovation #painpoint #assumptions #periodequity #popquiz #westin #marriott #holidayinn #hospitality #hotels #businesstravel

The supply chain is going to be a big #painpoint for CXOs worldwide this year and for the next few years. I see significant IT budgets getting invested in building resilience and adaptability within the #supplychain .#digitaltransformation #weeklyupdates #220423 (View in browser: https://bit.ly/3xOgEKt)Here are some supply chain developments this week:- SAP announced Q1 results. Christian Klein, SAP CEO: "Customers powered another quarter of strong cloud growth as they turned to us for solutions to make their businesses more sustainable, supply chains more resilient, and enterprises more future-proof. - Rajesh Gopinathan, TCS CEO, said Cyber security, building supply chains, various forms of data protection, and sovereignty-related issues would emerge as "big drivers for technology spend globally. - Kraft Heinz and Microsoft join forces to accelerate supply chain innovation in a broader digital transformation.#sustainability #supplychain #EV: The semiconductor supply shortage has thrown the global auto industry off balance. But a much greater shock is coming through #evbattery supply issues. The key challenge areas are the availability of raw materials (such as #lithium, #cobalt, & #nickel ), mining capacity, and processing. Lithium prices have already gone through the roof, and lithium is not scarce.Compact SUVs overtake hatchbacks as the most popular Indian car types: This change is one of the most significant #automobileindustry  changes in the last few decades. Probably, we are not asking 'kitna deti hai?' as much as we used to. Following macros manifest in this shift: First, The change in #consumerbehavior due to the rising per capita GDP (every milestone crossed in per capita GDP gives rise to the different industry segments boom and changing customer preferences). Second, more accessible financing options (thanks to all NBFCs-led credits). Third, #SupplyChain issues - SUVs with higher price tags help automakers to cover the cost of the global #chipshortage .Serving the under-served: Fundraise this week for MSME loans providers- Moneybox Fin ($15M fundraise) offers small-ticket loans to dairy farmers and shop owners. - Kinara Capital ($50M fundraise) provides collateral-free MSME loans within 24 hours. So far, the company has disbursed Rs.3,000 cr across 75,000 collateral-free business loans. Future of Work - The availability of high-speed internet through satellite will significantly impact the future of many industries: When a reliable internet is omnipresent and is available in every Indian village, it will change the future of many industries. Tata's Nelco & Telesat has already sought DoT's nod for an experimental license. In addition, Bharti has backed British satellite internet service provider OneWeb in the same space. This week, the telecom regulator TRAI suggested further enabling guidelines for the space.Thought of the week: "We suffer more in imagination than in reality." - Seneca.

Qualifying distracts from the real issue... What problem is your customer trying to solve? Could you actually solve that problem? Customer: "We must increase our efficiency." Customer: "There are too many clicks in X process." A vague pain point is not a real problem. These statements are being driven by real problems. A "too many clicks" issue is a symptom, not a root cause. Simple questions like, "Can you tell me more about that?" can help you uncover root causes. Finding and addressing the root cause of the problem is more likely to win deals than simply solving symptoms.#RevHeat #kenlundin #problemsolving #painpoint

#PainPoint Intersection #Analytics and Human-Centered #Solution Design are needed more in #healthcare to help improve the experience of care for patients and caregivers.During a #college tour this week with our daughter, one school identified a commonly shared dual pain point for all of us in college previously: #paying for each laundry load with quarters and #knowing where the open washers and dryers are near us on campus to minimize wait times.This college identified this shared pain point intersection among their students and updated their human-centered #design to eliminate the laundry counting quarters challenge that many of us have experienced by removing the “pay by laundry load” pain point. They also created an app with location based real-time identification of open washers and dryers nearby.#Imagine if we consistently used pain point intersection analytics in #healthcare to better understand and improve the care experience for patients and caregivers? #WhyNot The #PainPoint intersections reveal the #CollectiveValue creation opportunities. #HumanCenteredDesign #Healthcare

Weekend advice to CEOs.In my former place of work, I asked my boss his reasons for not attending the board meeting. He told me that the board did not request his presence. I ask why?🤔He told me the board do not realize the potential of HR professionals and how much they can contribute to the board.That brought about my becoming the human resource #businesspartner.I always wanted a seat at the board meeting.My Advice to CEOs.✔See your HR as a #partner, not #police. ✔HR should be a part of the team as they own the workplace and its output.✔See HR professionals as your partner and grow them as such.If HR does not attend board meetings or report directly to you, you cannot say your company cares about your talent.HR is more than a place to go for benefits or employee complaints.HR is the jack of all trades in the company.They are the leaders behind all things from hiring to developing and retention of employees.They do a lot of behind the scene work that goes into making sure culture, community and compensation are on point.HR diversity gives a lens many other employees don’t have.But the #painpoint is that many CEOs are not seen HR as a partner.HR professionals have valuable insight that CEOs could use to guide their companies.Create more opportunities to collaborate with the HR departments and #gainvalue.To HR Professional:Deliver results that enrich the organization’s value to #stakeholders .Leave the #traditionalHR activities--- Staffing and compensation but outcome.I remain your humble #humanresourcebusinesspartner @ Peace Mirabel.Your #business growth is my pride.#humanresource #businesspartner#gainvalue
