Personally, I strongly support activists and I even admire their activities (send petitions to the government & Parliament, or peacefully protest outside Westminster). However, I do not support blocking roads to demand changes, as this action does not convince people. Instead, it makes people feel absurd and annoying, especially when someone is in emergency and they want to go to hospital for treatment immediately. In case they could not get treatment on time, their life will be at risk and protesters who blocks roads will have to take responsibility for their actions. #protests Just Stop Oil: What is it and what are its goals?

Do you think protests are going too far? I do…The security industry has enough pressures without dealing with inconsiderate protestors. We are all for peaceful protests, but these people are putting lives at risk in an already busy city that needs security directed elsewhere.With over 500 arrests, there is a developing problem. There is a balance to be had between rights to protest and vandalism/anti-social behaviour. How can we encourage peaceful protests, and channel our security to the areas that matter?#londonprotests #security #policing #securityindustry #herongrange #protests

The same week as #nationalengineeringday protesters in one of the UK's most affluent towns, built around the river Thames have to protest against Thames Water dumping raw sewage into the middle of the heart of their community. Thank you Russel Brand for bringing attention to this, but as usual the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) are too busy baking cakes and patting each other on the back to even speak about the problem, let alone solve it. If Thames Water can fill the Thames with raw sewage without consequence, there is zero chance of solving the big environmental problems. Water is the least challenging of all process systems, and yet still the engineering in and around the environs of London fails so much that it subjects those around them to literally thousands of gallons of raw sewage dumped into their own river. I can only imagine the disgusting stench of it. Institutions should be tracking down those responsible, disciplining them and stripping them of their credentials, but instead it's all just one big Potemkin Village dumping its own sewage on the public, calling itself a 'charity'. Even after the CoVid-19 focus on hygiene and the prevention of disease transmission.

"This week, the Royal College of Nursing - Company voted to hold the biggest #strike in NHS history over pay and conditions, while activists from Just Stop Oil have blocked part of the M25 for the second day running in ongoing climate #protestsThe reason I’m putting these two examples together – striking nurses and climate protesters – is because the reaction to both of these events has a common thread running through itHow selfish! How utterly, completely, eye-poppingly self-centred of #nurses to want to be able to look after you and your sick and dying relatives in safe conditions! And to be remunerated fairly, so they don’t have to leave the NHS for a better paid job in a supermarket or get by using #foodbanks. And to have safe levels of staffing, so that patients don’t suffer, and to be protected from abuse at work. Outrageous!As for Just Stop Oil, can’t they just nudge powerful decision-makers into tackling the #climatecrisis that will – if left unchecked – probably wipe out all life on Earth by doing something just a bit... quieter and easier to ignore?What the cries of “#selfishness” directed at both nurses (heroes of the pandemic, clap on your doorstep, remember that?) – and climate activists (deadly floods and heatwaves, the planet on a “highway to hell”, remember that?) – reveal is that this country has lost sight of what direct action is actually forProtests and strikes are supposed to be disruptive. They’re meant to inconvenience people. If you want to draw attention to an ongoing existential issue that those in power would rather not deal with, you need to go big – or go homeThere’s far too much debate about “acceptable” protest; about demonstrating in the “right way” – which overshadows the issues at hand (just look at the Van Gogh soup debacle). This plays right into the hands of those who didn’t want to address what activists are protesting about in the first placeGrant Shapps, once transport secretary, now business secretary told LBC on Tuesday that he hoped protesters would spend Christmas in prisonRewind to the early 20th century, put Shapps in a Rees-Mogg style top hat and he’d be scribbling pamphlets about how the suffragettes should shush or be force-fed harder in jail. Until the outbreak of the First World War, more than 1,000 women fighting for the right to vote were imprisoned in BritainThink of it this way: if industrial action doesn’t put anyone out – if no one is affected, no one notices, everything runs as normal – then what, exactly, is the point of it? Strikes occur when negotiations fail. Making them convenient renders them toothless, and workers completely powerless."... (cont)

One of my friends suggested the idea of "protest organizer" (similar to event organizer). On further thoughts, this sounds like a cool startup idea. The startup can provide end-to-end protest solutions. This includes services such as analysing various police cases and news reports to shortlist the suitable ones for protesting, identifying suitable locations for protest, getting the required approvals from police, providing candles and matchbox, arranging the mini-marathon track for candle march, providing refreshments at regular intervals, coming up with creative slogans, printing the placards, booking LOLa cabs for the protestors, creating professional protest selfies for LinkedIn posts, managing reward points scheme for protests, discount coupon for next protest, and so much more.In the next phase, we could even offer PaaS (Protest as a Service) where people can simply buy subscription packs for protests, and our staff will protest for them. There could be multiple subscription tiers, such as "Free", "Basic", "Special" and "Premium", where the customer can choose how much and in what ways they want us to protest for them.Of course, like everything else, we will shoehorn some AI/ML into it. We can build a "recommendation engine" to suggest suitable protests to customers based on their past protests, estimate the protest potential of ongoing incidents to prioritise the protesting, or even predict upcoming incidents that may be protest worthy.Who would like to be my co-founder to build this startup? #StartupIndia #Protests

GAO bid protest stats get a lot of attention.But what about SBA size/status protests?A recent SBA OIG report includes some intriguing data.Out of 364 size/status protests filed in FY21, more than half (52%) were dismissed.The deadlines are very tight for size/status protests and they might not be an available option depending on the type of procurement at issue. A large dismissal percentage is likely due to untimeliness and other procedural defects.Putting aside the dismissals, there were 174 protests decided on the merits. Of those, more than 37% were sustained. By comparison, the GAO sustain rate last year was 13%.Unlike a GAO protest, there are no Pyrrhic victories in SBA protests.  A sustained SBA protest will disqualify your competitor and there is no “corrective action” to salvage the original award. So next time you are on the losing end of a set-aside remember that a size/status protest may be your best bet to overturning the award. #governmentcontracting #sba #protests #procurement

#ACTIVISM: Climate activists are conducting a rolling campaign of protests on the M25 motorway this week. Activists are climbing overhead gantries which forces the police to close the motorway whilst protesters are safely removed. This is the third day of protests around rush hour which are causing significant traffic disruption. Logistics operators are recommended to factor additional travel time for their shipments, avoid the M25 if possible or avoid travelling on the M25 during rush hour.

Kowtowing California-based Apple has been criticized in the past for making changes to iPhone features to appease the Chinese government. In one example, the iPhone maker took heat in 2019 for hiding the Taiwanese flag emoji for users in Hong Kong or Macau. It also removed apps for virtual private networks, or VPNs, which are commonly used to circumvent the country’s internet firewall. Many of Apple’s own services are also inaccessible in China -- the world’s biggest smartphone market -- including Apple TV+, the iTunes Store, paid podcasts, Apple Books and Apple Arcade. #china #iphone #kowtow #protests

The current protest at Amsterdam airport is crossing a dangerous line. Of course, protest is important to voice your convictions, even if it inconveniences others.However, the current events are not only affecting the super-rich in their private jets. According to the news, a medical flight had to be redirected to another airport because it couldn't land in Amsterdam. Such a redirection of a medical transport can have life-threatening consequences because the subsequent transport of the patient to the hospital must now be improvised and takes longer. Every additional minute equals an unnecessary risk. That's why we call for different means of protest in the future.#amsterdam #schiphol #protests

#Protests are nothing new in #iran. There were 4,000 protests in the first half of 2022 alone. But when the protests, triggered by the death of #Mahsa_Jhina_Amini, started a few weeks ago, Hamid Talebian and I immediately had the feeling that this time something was different. Iranians, united for the first time in a very long time, weren't asking for #reforms but for a change in the political system. Seing the brutal crackdown of protests by the Iranian #regime, we wondered what the response of the international community could be. How would and could especially states, with a so-called #feministforeignpolicy react? We often had the impression that people are triggered by the word #feminist and tend to believe it's a policy for women only. To those people I would like to say that it's not. It's not about excluding, but including. With our article we wanted to clear up these misconceptions.Now, are the recommendations that we make enough to bring about change in Iran? Absolutely not! But we have to start somewhere and sometimes even the smallest steps can pave the way. Also, a feminist foreign policy is not something you attain by changing a policy here and there. It is a radical transformation and such profound transformations need time to be truely sustainable.I honestly don't know what the future holds for Iran and its people, but I do know that fighting for a foreign policy that is not solely based on national and economic interests but also on the interests of the people it is targeting, is worthwile. Because at the end a feminist foreign policy is an #inclusive and human-centered policy. And isn't this something worth striving for?

Some people say that the protests from Chisinau are not "for democracy(?)" but against it,  that the protests are "staged & paid" by the Russians, or by pro-Russian parties, while others are saying that the so-called West camp, in this context: Maia Sandu +  Zelenskyy + Ursula etc, is to be blamed for the critical situation of the economy, etc.   In other words, the protests are interpreted according to the camp to which the dis/information source belongs, officially or not.  But no matter how they are presented, one thing is clear: the series of crises caused by the current security situation in the region deepens the discontent of people who do not make politics but are hit by the decisions of those who do. In the case of the Moldovans, their economic situation is much more precarious; they are much poorer than other Eastern Europeans, and keeping in mind that a large part of the Moldovan workforce used to work in Russia before February 2022,  of course, now, they are directed affected by the strained relations between Moldova and Russia. As such,  these days they see themselves stuck, like the citizens of many other regional states, between the interests of powers that don't give a damn about them, their daily piece of bread, etc. Of course, the real protests have yet to start en masse in Europe. If things continue to go in this direction, I estimate that in the first three months of next year, many protests will degenerate into real security crises.#moldova #protests #poverty #unemployment #inflation #war #geopoliticalgames "Protests again in Chisinau, Moldova, the people calling for the resignation of President Sandu and the normalization of relations with Russia.

#Irán - El comandante en jefe de la Guardia Revolucionaria de Irán, Hossein Salami, advirtió este sábado 29 de octubre a los manifestantes que esta jornada sería la última de las protestas que iniciaron hace más de un mes por la muerte de la joven Mahsa Amini. Una señal de que las fuerzas de seguridad podrían intensificar su represión en medio de los disturbios que asolan al país. La mayor ola de protestas en Irán en años irrita a las autoridades, que amenazan con acabarlas. Este sábado 29 de octubre, el comandante en jefe de la Guardia Revolucionaria, el general Hossein Salami, advirtió a los ciudadanos que las manifestaciones pronto tendrían que acabar. “Hoy es el final de los disturbios. ¡No salgan más a las calles! (…) Le estamos diciendo a nuestra juventud, la minoría de ustedes que han sido engañados, detengan los actos malvados”, sostuvo Salami. La amenaza se produce en momentos en que la Policía y otras fuerzas de seguridad intentan contener de forma violenta a los activistas, con munición real, perdigones antidisturbios y gases lacrimógenos. Hasta el momento la Guardia Revolucionaria no ha sido desplegada, por lo que muchos temen que tras las declaraciones de su comandante en jefe la represión aumente. Sin embargo, los iraníes han desafiado las amenazas a lo largo de la revuelta popular, en la que los jóvenes y las mujeres han jugado un papel destacado. #iran #protests #demonstrations #countryrisk #riskmanagement #intelligence

So, was the weather this past weekend wonderful or horrific?  The unseasonably warm sunshine was a treat out on the bike, but you just can't help feeling how wrong it is.  But for most it seems the former experience still trumps the latter.Yesterday out cycling we saw butterflies and ladybirds, a field of rape in flower, a man out walking in shorts and a vest and, along with most of the customers, we sat and enjoyed our drinks outside the pub......in mid-November.  As it happens, the current UK weather owes more to a temporary change in the direction of the jet-stream than to climate change per se, but it comes towards the end of a year where every month has been warmer than average.  Yet most people are counting themselves lucky, not hanging heir heads in despair about what this means for the future.Perhaps this is one reason that more people seem to be upset that Just Stop Oil protestors on the M25 last week made them late for something which in another years time they will have forgotten all about, when the issue at stake is genuinely existential.  The Metropolitan police assistant commissioner claimed that the protestors action was "disproportionate to any legitimate aim they may have".  As David Mitchell questions in his usual entertaining way yesterday, "disproportionate? They're stopping traffic because they think the world is ending.  And unlike various religious groups down the centuries, there's a decent chance they may be right". So the question remains, where will the tipping point be that makes enough people feel that the human race is under threat that they don't mind being late for something of personal importance, because it is actually more important that the governments of the world need to take drastic action for the greater good of the climate, nature and mankind?  Obviously an exceptionally mild November with glorious sunshine isn't it.https://lnkd.in/eu4-7PRb#climateemergency #juststopoil #protests

Despite the frustration of seeing parasitical politicians dragging the country down decade after decade for three quarters of a century, if I have any hopes of seeing Sri Lanka rise from the ashes, it is because there appears to be a crop of passionate young professionals who were brave enough to take on the establishment. One such person was Nirmani Liyanage whom I had the privilege of meeting a few years ago, when she made a presentation to a social service assocoation I am a member of on underprivileged children in urban settings. She impressed us with her technical insights as much as with her compassionate heart.Minutes ago, I gathered from social media that Nirmani is no more. Though she is gone, I pray that the passion and yearning for a better Sri Lanka that she had will live on in the hearts of our young people and take this beautiful nation to higher ground.#srilanka

Protests in Iran have been going on non-stop for seven weeks. Images are harrowing. The death toll reached 300. What brought the country to this situation? Western influence during the Pahlavi dynasty? Interests on oil extraction? Mehdi Alavi, Ph.D., MBA and Atul Singh contextualize the current state of affairs and help us make sense of these events by diving into the history previous to the Islamic Republic of Iran, this, began with the Islamic Revolution in 1979, which overthrew the Pahlavi dynasty.  "Currently, Iran is ruled by mullahs. Iran’s theocratic regime is disliked by the US and its allies, if not despised.Many, including prominent Iranians, blame the mullahs for all of Iran’s ills.However, few are aware of an inconvenient truth. The #British paved the path to power for the mullahs, with the Americans constructing the mile."#help #events #power #protests #iranprotests #iran #iranianwomen #oil

Protests starts at home.Start by writing letters! Amnesty International 2022 campaign focuses on the right to protest. Throughout history, people coming together to demonstrate against injustice have changed the world for the better, from stopping wars to acting against racism. Protest is powerful, but this precious right is under attack globally from politicians, governments and regimes who fear change and accountability. The people featured in Write for Rights 2022 know this only too well: they were all punished for using their right to protest. But your messages can bring about real change, pressuring authorities to free prisoners and protect the vulnerable. They also provide comfort and support for those who are doing the difficult and often dangerous work of speaking out for human rights. How Global Solidarity Works:• More than 500,000 actions were taken for Bernardo Caal Xol, an Indigenous teacher, trade unionist and environmental campaigner in Guatemala. He was released from prison in March 2022. • More than 660,000 actions were taken for Zhang Zhan, a citizen journalist who spoke out about politics and human rights in China.

This is really worth a #listen... just out on BBC sounds yesterdaySome great conversation and truth telling from the panel, albeit BBC still rather lacking on it's own embarrassing blind spots and almost total lack of ability to join the dots eg, between 'economic growth', climate collapse and food systems collapse, and how that isn't journalistic 'activism'... let's hope they get there very soon!"How should #journalists cover #climate #protests? The climate conference #cop27 ends this week. But you might have seen more about the activists who threw oil on a Gustav #Klimt painting in Vienna yesterday. Or the protesters who brought the #M25 to a standstill last week. In an era of apparently increasing direct action, what’s the media’s role? And by giving the latest stunt publicity, is it fanning the flames?Guests: Fiona Harvey, Environment Correspondent, The Guardian, Cameron Ford, spokesperson, Insulate Britain, Rich Felgate, documentary-maker, Wolfgang Blau, Managing Partner, the Climate Hub at the Brunswick Group, and Danny Shaw, former BBC home affairs correspondent."

On Thursday, November 17th, Tabitha Woodruff and I presented at the National Association of Social Workers Ohio Chapter 2022 Annual Conference! About 35 people attended our session, "Meeting the Community Where They Are: A Social Worker's Guide to Protester Rights and Resources." We outlined the social work link to social justice actions, informed attendees about their constitutional rights and best practices when interacting with law enforcement, and identified community resources available to support protesters. I'm not sure when this photo was taken, but it was probably taken when advising the group to NEVER consent to a police search. Never. Ever.

When are the Just Stop Oil protesters going to realise what they're doing is counter-productive? Everybody wants climate improvement and to make their contribution to #netzero (we've cut our home energy and vehicle usage by two-thirds since 2019), but the stress generated for people who have no influence upon these matters, or who miss medical appointments, or who have mental health challenges, will at best cause people and #business to lose money precisely when it's the last thing they need, or shorten lives through consequential medical episodes. Some protests are tone deaf. These are prime examples. Does anybody see Sir David Attenborough super-gluing himself to #roads or climbing motorway gantries? Would anybody doubt the effectiveness of his campaigning...? #mentalhealth #medical #money #energy #oil #economy #m25 #protests #climatechange

Measures around UK public order policing that were defeated in the Police, Courts, Crime and Sentencing Bill are now making their way through Parliament in the Public Order Bill, prompting impassioned debate along the way; Senior Policing Lecturer Owen West MSt (Cantab), a former chief superintendent and public order policing specialist, argues that while the proposals may enthuse government supporters, they are not in the interest of the public or the police service."In what some might say was misdirection from the ongoing political turbulence, Ms Braverman famously derided those who criticised the Bill as ‘tofu-eating wokerati’ during last month’s Commons debate.""It appears the current Home Secretary, through the Public Order Bill, is now seeking to legislate in favour of some of the very tactics that have led to a public inquiry, instigated by a former Conservative Home Secretary.""There are facts to keep in mind here. Firstly, the criminal law already covers these types of protest tactics. Secondly, the surest way to engender and sustain protest activity is to seek to ban or inhibit it."https://lnkd.in/eGpZs22w#lawenforcement #policing #police #publicorder #protests #legislation

“From the #ArabSpring in 2010–11 through #Sudan’s 2019 #revolution, protests in the #region have often erupted in the wake of the #deaths of young #men. This is the first time in the region’s recent #history that a nationwide uprising has been ignited by the death of a young #woman—and one from an #ethnicminority group, no less.When #women are on the frontlines, mass #movements have a higher chance of succeeding and are likelier to lead to more egalitarian #democracy. This is one of the reasons today’s #protests are so threatening to the Iranian #regime.Movements in which women play a prominent #role tend to attract much larger numbers of participants. On average, they are about seven times as large as movements that sideline women—and larger movements are more likely to succeed.”#MahsaAmini#WomanLifeFreedom

Iran to attack Kingdom of Saudi Arabia?  How likely is it? THREAD- As a MENA watcher, I often realize many threats while cannot be avoided are inflated to an extent wherein news makes headlines, but little do we know what could transpire. Having said that, I personally think that the Iranian regime would not dare to attack Saudi Arabia directly. Although I do concur that another round of proxy war could eventually take place due to the following 3 reasons, these reasons are interlinked with how Iran perceives itself and how it is now perceived in the region. #iran #saudiarabia #attack #proxywarfare #hezbollah #houthis #protests #lebanon #yemen #unitedstates #uae #russiaukrainewar #china #geopolitics #menaregion #risks #explanation

Happy to have a byline with a pic of my in-conversation session with the 2022 #BookerPrize winner Shehan Karunatilaka yday at the Shj Book Fair. He spoke about Sri Lanka’s never-ending crisis - its two decade long civil war, tsunami, Easter attacks and the recent political and economic mayhem. For Karunatilaka, who grew up in Colombo, the protests were also a show of the power of the written word in uniting people.“The power of the written word is not in novels, it is in Twitter, on Facebook, on TikTok even. Sometimes, those things can bring down governments and effect change,“ he said.Full story here in the link below  https://lnkd.in/db7UEQdP#srilanka #protests #people #authors #people #crisis #

An interesting speech that seems to have had all the "ingredients" to convince, and yet the link that connects the whole speech is completely missing. Obviously, I'm trying to tell you everything without saying anything."The President of the Republic of Moldova, Maia Sandu, delivered a speech in the Romanian Parliament, where she warned that for Russia there are no limits or rules, so “we are all in danger”. “If, through their courage and love of the nation, the Ukrainians did not stand up to the Russian Federation, where would Russia go? To the Dniester, to the Prut?” said Maia Sandu. She emphasized that the citizens of her country want to be part of the European family and have the chance of a life in freedom and peace.Maia Sandu attended the international conference “Parliamentary women from Romania and the promotion of gender equality as a national commitment”, organized by the Parliament of Romania.“For me, in these times, it is a huge responsibility, I will do everything I can so that the Republic of Moldova is on the good side of history so that people can live in peace, free and dignified at home. I am honoured to be here today and I can thank Romania. We ardently want to be part of the big European family. For three decades we have stagnated in a grey area. Our citizens no longer want to live in the grey area, without the chance of a normal life, a normal life as they saw in European countries. We want to be a zone of freedom and peace, we appreciate the help and know how to do our duty as European citizens. Moldova is already contributing to a stronger and more united Europe by effectively participating in managing the effects of war,” Maia Sandu said.“Today, our citizens live with concern for the future of their children. Russia started a war because it thought it was allowed to do anything. If the Ukrainians did not stand up to the Russian Federation through their courage and patriotism, where was Russia going? To the Dniester, to the Prut? (..).“In these tragic times, we rely on the free world, so that in the future the free world will rely on the Republic of Moldova, as a guarantor of peace and security. This is what the free and brave people of this land honestly fought for, valuable people who fulfil their duty, who work honestly, who want to be respected at home, and who say “please” and “thank you”. Today, on behalf of the Republic of Moldova, I say “thank you” and on behalf of all our citizens “please”. (..)."#moldova #maiasandu #energycrisis #poverty #protests

WSJ [excerpt]: #China’s leadership issued a notice last Friday that instructed local governments to ease #Covid controls, cut the length of quarantines and reduce unnecessary mass testing.But recent editorials in The People’s Daily—the Chinese Communist Party’s flagship publication—continued to call on China’s population to stick with its approach of staying vigilant and nipping outbreaks in the bud.The mixed messaging has left local governments trying to figure out how to handle Covid cases without resorting to the most stringent measures of China’s zero-tolerance approach.At Thursday’s briefing, #Beijing also unveiled plans for the hospital system to deal with a surge of new infections by building more facilities for treating severe Covid cases, and to ensure that intensive-care units account for 10% of all hospital beds to tend to the most vulnerable patients.China has relaxed the categories of people who need to be isolated in response to last Friday’s loosening instructions, but it still requires every infected person and close contacts to enter #quarantine.On Thursday, #Guangzhou announced plans to add beds for nearly a quarter of a million people to handle surging infections, including 132,015 in hospital isolation wards and 114,392 for people who are infected but have no symptoms.Sudden and sometimes prolonged closures of workplaces, schools and neighborhoods have been fueling frustration and #protests across China this year.On Thursday, public anger welled up again over a child’s death that was blamed on excessive pandemic measures. A 4-month-old girl died after suffering vomiting and diarrhea while in quarantine at a hotel in #Zhengzhou, according to local news reports.Emergency services had balked at treating her on Monday because the father had tested positive with the virus, the reports said, citing an account of the incident posted on social media by her father. The girl was sent to a hospital 11 hours after he first called, but died despite efforts to revive her, the reports said.#news

Climate change and political unrest are giving rise to increasing protests, globally and in the UK.So what do you do if employees skip work to join a mass protest? Even those who have a previously unblemished unauthorised absence record? Employees can’t expect to skip off work to protest and not face repercussions. You need to make it very clear that they have to book holiday to take time off to protest. If they do go AWOL or pull a sickie on the day, you need to attempt to contact them and document everything. Alternatively, if you see them on TV clearly out and about as part of a protest, press record and ring us for advice.If however, the issue is climate change and your company ethos plays a part in addressing this, actively communicate it to staff so that they feel they are already contributing.

#Pakistan - Although there are no reported fatalities yet from the shots fired today by a lone assailant on the PTI caravan and of mass supporters, on their way to the capital Islamabad, there will be serious repercussions. Opposition leader, Imran Khan, was shot in the leg and reportedly disembarked his truck in full consciousness. The crowds attracted by Khan’s populist rhetoric against the corruption and institutional interference of the current army-intelligence leadership and their recently rehabilitated partners among the established political elite (ie the Sharif brothers’ PMLN and Zardari’s PPP) are of a size unseen in recent history. The shooting likely narrows the room for compromise, inflaming the passions of Khan’s supporters and making those he criticises even less popular. The key demand from Khan is an early general election, rather than the removal of the army chief, Qamar Javed Bajwa, or a specific choice for Bajwa’s successor (as his term ends this month). The election is due before October 2023 but the driver of the protests is the alleged manipulation of the parliamentary vote of no confidence earlier this year, which led to the fall of Khan’s government, and the PTI’s victory in most of the subsequent by-elections. The absence of any visibility over the political outlook – with scenarios ranging from an early election (where Khan’s PTI is the favourite), a muddle-through of the existing PMLN-PPP government and the imposition of martial law all equally likely – means any short-term investment case in local currency assets is hard to support.#elections #pti #imrankhan #imrankhanpti #geopolitics #nawazsharif #shehbazsharif #asifzardari #bajwa #protests #politicalrisk

"Until 2018, domain fronting enabled by Google, Amazon, and Microsoft allowed web users to circumvent internet bans and surveillance. Will they reinstate it in Iran? ... “One thing people don’t talk about is domain fronting,” says Mahsa Alimardani, an internet researcher at the University of Oxford and Article19, a human rights organization focused on freedom of expression and information. It’s a technique developers used for years to skirt internet restrictions like those that have made it incredibly difficult for Iranians to communicate safely. In essence, domain fronting allows apps to disguise traffic directed toward them; for instance, when someone types a site into a web browser, this technique steps into that bit of browser-to-site communication and can scramble what the computer sees on the back end to disguise the end site’s true identity. ...The likelihood that Amazon or Google will reinstate domain fronting depends on “how cynical you are about their profit motives versus their good intentions for the world,” Hunstad adds."#medialiteracy #mediapsychology #cybersecurity #iranprotests2022 #iran #iranianwomen #iranian #humanrights #google #amazon #microsoft #protest #protests #freespeech #surveillance

Pressure group’s protest stalls business in Shillong.The city of Shillong has been facing violent protests by pressure groups including HYC, HANM, EJNC, JSM and Corp. Tight security arrangements have been made by the administration after the FKJGP rally that turned violent on the city streets. The protests have been under control for some while now. Four pressure groups under the banner of “Save Hynniewtrep Mission” have still staged protests in two different locations of the city-one near the SP office and the DC office point- in the city. The demands of the protestors include the introduction of ILP in the state, inclusion of the Khasi language in the Eighth schedule, review of the inter-state boundary MoU with Assam, relocation of Harijan colony, CBI or Judicial probe into the killing of Late Cherristerfield Thangkhiew and filling up of the vacant posts in Government Departments.

Thanks to Chatham House for arranging a panel event on the protests in Iran, and helping clear up my understanding of the current trajectories of the protests in the country. Especially interesting were the rich insights of Rob Macaire, the UK’s ambassdor to Iran (2018-2021); Hussein Ibish, senior resident scholar in the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington; and finally, to Robin Wright of The New Yorker. As a student of Politics, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of developments on hot topics, especially that of the ongoing protests in Iran as they have been uncovered by civilian reporters through social media, and therefore we may not fully have the full picture as the regime resists the flow of information. Finally, thanks to Sanam Vakil for facilitating the discussion and looking forward to attending future Chatham House events on Iran as the situation develops.  #event #policypanel #protests

Despite a widening crackdown, including an ominous ultimatum from the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps this past Saturday that it would be "the last day" of the #MahsaAmini #protests, defiant Iranians continue to take to the streets across the country. What impacts could the protests in Iran have across the Middle East, both for pro-democracy and human rights activists in Arab countries and their widely repressive governments? To understand the potential implications beyond Iran, Democracy in Exile asked a wide range of experts and observers.“There is a precedent for this sequencing of events where demands for structural political change in Iran reverberate and inspire similar political demands in the Arab world,” said Nader Hashemi of the Josef Korbel School of International Studies, University of Denver.“Iran’s ongoing protests will have considerable impact on the entire Middle East, not just Iran’s Gulf neighbors,” Seifeddine Ferjani, a Tunisian political analyst, explained reverberations in Tunisia. “It may create another wave in the region, a sense of inevitable change.” “For pro-democracy and #humanrights #activists, the Iranian struggle is not just a struggle of #women seeking autonomy, but also of minority ethno-religious groups seeking equality and representation in the nation,” said Marsin Alshamary, an Iraqi-American researcher.Others disagree. “For Gulf activists and reformists, there is sympathy and amazement for the bravery of the women protesters in Iran. But the moment is not auspicious for a wave to join them,” explains Kristin Smith Diwan, scholar at the The Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. “Woman, life, freedom—all three await full realization across the Gulf.” Read the roundtable to learn from more experts— https://lnkd.in/efVKS34p

Mobile Apps and Social UpheavalTechnology is a double-edged sword in the fight for the future or Iran. Both the protestors and the government are using apps to achieve their goals. Data shows a 1,000 percent daily increase in the number of Iranians signing up for VPNs to stay under the radar in the crackdown.Protestors in Tehran fear arrest, beatings and even death by joining mass protests demanding more rights and a new leadership in Iran. But a yearning for change and a varied bag of tech solutions, from mobile apps to encrypted chat, have kept them going.Struggling to suppress the biggest show of dissent in years, Iran’s authorities have also turned to technology, using delivery apps, Twitter and facial recognition to track protesters, eavesdrop on opponents and harass women who defy their strict dress code.#technology #change #tech #data #mobileappdevelopment #mobileapplications #mobileapps #apps #protests #socialchange #iran #iranprotests #iranprotests2022 #humanrights #humanrightsviolations #womenempowerment #womensrights #womensrightsarehumanrights https://lnkd.in/esAhTXFV

Election security preparations are necessarily concerned with the safety of early and day-of voters casting ballots as well as the processing or certification of results, protests that can stem from whether or not a candidate accepts those results or chooses to fan discontent among supporters, or potential attacks against election infrastructure itself or the officials overseeing what may be perceived to be flawed systems or procedures.Source: GTSC's Homeland Security Todayhttps://lnkd.in/edgJ5raN#violence #attack #attacks #extremism #extremists #violentextremism #election #highthreat #threat #threats #infrastructure #CI #tech #technology #protest #protests #civilunrest #unrest #civildisturbance #publicsafety #safety #security

V.S. Naipaul was of the opinion that this was not entirely possible, and probably not even partially. In fact, it may never happen even partially, let alone fully. For he believed that Iran's pre-Islamic Zoroastrian culture and greatness, or Iran's true cultural identity, shared with "Aryan" India, was so thoroughly destroyed that it, to this day, can't be recovered and is essentially defunct. Lots of it or most of it is at the very least irrecoverable. Maybe that explains why they keep reverting back to stagnation and backwardness, especially after their unsuccessful attempts and notable efforts to save and to reclaim their Aryan heritage and the pre-Islamic, Zoroastrian past. Naturally, this hasn't gone unnoticed. Nader Naderpour as cited in Saad 1996 even went as far as to compare the establishment of the Islamic Republic to the Arab Muslim conquest of the Sassanid Empire, and suggested that it is in fact a continuation of that same defeat of superior Iranian culture. https://lnkd.in/g_g8Dxfc #india #culture #iran #protests #iranprotests2022 #iranprotests2022 😪

Depuis la mort de Mahsa Amini le 16 septembre dernier, l’Iran fait face à un soulèvement sans précédent. Des femmes d’abord, très vite rejointes par des hommes et toute la jeunesse iranienne unie, sont descendus dans les rues pour demander un changement de régime. Leur slogan : “Femme, Vie, Liberté”.Le 27 septembre dernier, le jeune chanteur iranien Shervin Hajipour publie la chanson “Barayé”, écrite en s’inspirant de tweets d’internautes iranien·ne·s. 40 millions de vues plus tard, le jeune homme est arrêté. Libéré sous caution, il est depuis réduit au silence. Un immense merci à toutes celles et ceux qui ont participé à ce clip, réalisé par Marjane Satrapi sur un arrangement musical de Benjamin Biolay et produit par @Le Collectif 50/50.

“…the reality is that none of it matters. Not the cabinet, not parliament, not the presidency and who occupies it. Not to us–the people, both the blessed and the damned. And this absence of the state to her citizens, like an abusive mother’s dereliction towards her children, also sets us apart in the club of the maligned. Ever since her inception, the Lebanese state has been teaching us how to live without her where it counts the most and how to duck and hide from her when she is in the mood to harass and taunt.”#lebanon #beirut #collapse #poverty #wealth #inequility #corruption #waste #civilwar #protests

#Colombia - Miles de personas marcharon este sábado por las calles de ciudades colombianas como Bogotá y Medellín para mostrar su desacuerdo con el Gobierno de Gustavo Petro y sus medidas, como la reforma tributaria que quiere impulsar en el Congreso. Unas 8.000 personas salieron de diversos puntos de Bogotá hacia la céntrica Plaza Bolívar, que acoge el Congreso, donde, con banderas de Colombia y pancartas entonaron el himno de Colombia y gritaron «Petro, bandido, el pueblo está ofendido», pidiendo su renuncia, o arengaron a las fuerzas militares. Según la senadora uribista el Gobierno «está poniendo unos impuestos exagerados y prohibiendo la exploración de petróleo y gas que está llevando el sector de hidrocarburos, que es la base de la macroeconomía de este país, al colapso», haciendo referencia a los anuncios -algo contradictorios- del Gobierno de paralizar nuevas exploraciones de hidrocarburos como un gesto hacia el medioambiente. El presidente de la Unión de Trabajadores de la Industria Petrolera y Enérgica de Colombia, Alejandro Ospina, aseguró que es falso que haya que acabar con esta industria para «mitigar la crisis climática» y que eso solo traerá «mayor pobreza y mayor impacto ambiental». La oposición asegura que la reforma tributaria -que en 2021 ya sacó a decenas de miles de personas a las calles en unas multitudinarias protestas cuando el expresidente Iván Duque quiso impulsar una tributaria algo diferente- «puede destruir el sector productivo de este país». Por eso piden al Gobierno que «escuche a la ciudadanía» y continúe el legado que han dejado otros gobiernos porque «no puede llegar a destruir», en palabras de Valencia. #latinamerica #protests #demonsrtrations #politics #countryrisk #intelligence

💭 I've been thinking about the recent protests in the oil and gas industry, and the chemical manufacturing one too... 🦺 Does it change the approach businesses - within those circles - take with worker safety? And does it change their stance on voice communication and data communication within their daily operation? What do people in these industries think?

#Bolivia - El Comité Cívico de Bolivia rechazó nuevamente la propuesta del gobierno de Luis Arce de instalar mesas técnicas para fijar la fecha en la que se celebre el Censo por lo que el paro se mantendrá activo en la octava jornada de protestas en Santa Cruz. El presidente del Comité Cívico, Rómulo Calvo, afirmó tras la reunión celebrada este viernes en la ciudad de Cochabamba, en el centro del país, que el gobierno “sigue subestimando el sacrificio de una población que está exigiendo un derecho”. “Han querido callar la voz de un cabildo, la voz de un millón y medio de personas, que pidieron una fecha, una fecha que le hemos dicho al pueblo boliviano, no se negocia”. El Gobierno se ha hecho el sordo; nos ha demostrado que no tiene voluntad para dar solución”, señaló en declaraciones recogidas por el periódico de Santa Cruz El Deber. El representante sostuvo que lo que el Ejecutivo ha puesto sobre la mesa no responde a lo determinado por el Cabildo que señala que el Censo debe realizarse en el 2023. El denominado “movimiento cívico” de Bolivia inició el pasado sábado un paro nacional indefinido para demandar la celebración del Censo en 2023, en lugar del 2024 como ha propuesto el gobierno boliviano, ya que esta estadística condiciona el reparto de registros entre las regiones del país. #latinamerica #demonstrations #protests #countryrisk #intelligence

#ACTIVISM: We spoke about the threat of activism recently in a joint webinar with the Transported Asset Protection Association. In this incident climate activists carried out a coordinated action to block three busy intersections on the A-100 highway in Berlin during rush hour. Activist protests can impact trucks directly if in the wrong place at the wrong time and also indirectly in the form of delays which can mean drivers do not reach their secure parking spot for the night. Trucks parked overnight at non-secure parking areas are vulnerable to cargo theft and fuel siphoning incidents.

As someone with working knowledge in both environmental & wildlife conservation and the art industry, I find that acts of violence only begets more violence. I hope #juststopoil understands that a soup can for an eye is still violence. Retaliation seems a poor substitute for action towards a good cause. Art has long been used to communicate radical and complex issues. In many ways, it makes sense to use art as a medium, turning it into the message itself. Throwing cans of food at art hardly helps the cause of #environmental #conservation or #social #justice. The logic of "what is wasting a couple cans of food for a righteous cause" goes against the very essence of their message of "there is starvation, disease and death - let's help them".  Attention is what they wanted. Attention is what they have now. What are they going to do with it? What now? #art #education #protests #juststopoil #consequences #whatnow

#Brasil - El caos vial desatado en varias partes de Brasil por manifestantes bolsonaristas ha obligado a las autoridades estatales a movilizar a la policía. Los mandatarios de los tres Estados más poblados del país, aliados del presidente Jair Bolsonaro, han mandado a las fuerzas de seguridad para dar cumplimiento a una orden del Supremo Tribunal Federal que pide la liberación “inmediata” de las vías de comunicación cerradas. Las protestas de grupos de camioneros y otros seguidores del mandatario contra la victoria de Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva han afectado a más de 300 carreteras en una veintena de estados. Bolsonaro ha dicho este martes que simpatizaba con el sentimiento detrás de los bloqueos, pero que no con el método. Tras horas de bloqueos en las carreteras, las autoridades estatales han dado un golpe sobre la mesa. Reunido en gabinete de crisis, el gobernador de São Paulo, Rodrigo Garcia, que apoyó a Bolsonaro en la segunda vuelta, ha dicho que los bloqueos eran “inadmisibles”. “La elección ya acabó”, ha señalado, a su vez, Romeu Zema, de Minas Gerais, otro aliado del actual presidente. El Gobierno de Río de Janeiro también ha enviado a la policía estatal a liberar las carreteras. En algunos casos, las fuerzas de seguridad han utilizado gases lacrimógenos para dispersar a los manifestantes. La movilización de los gobernadores responde a una orden del Supremo Tribunal Federal que pide liberar las autopistas y faculta, además, a las policías estatales a intervenir en cualquier tipo de vías, incluso las federales. Los camioneros que se resistan enfrentan, según la resolución, una multa de 100.000 reales por hora, unos 20.000 euros. El ministro Alexandre de Moraes también ha avisado al director de la Policía Federal de Carreteras, Silvinei Vasques, un bolsonarista declarado, de que puede ser detenido si no cumple con la orden. Desde la derrota electoral de Bolsonaro el domingo por la noche, se han registrado cientos de bloqueos. Entre las vías que se han visto afectadas en algún momento, están la principal carretera entre Río de Janeiro y São Paulo y la que comunica esta ciudad con el aeropuerto internacional de Garulhos, el mayor del país, que tuvo que cancelar 25 vuelos hasta la mañana del martes. En la estación de autobuses de São Paulo, las empresas interrumpieron la venta de pasajes para Río de Janeiro. Los que intentaron realizar el viaje en la tarde del lunes tuvieron que volverse al punto de partida y los viajeros, pasar la noche en la estación. Los bloqueos han llegado a afectar el transporte de productos agrícolas. La Asociación Brasileña de Supermercados apuntó a las “dificultades de abastecimiento” y pidió “apoyo” a Bolsonaro para resolver la situación. #latinamerica #protests #demonstrations #countryrisk #intelligence

There are several issues we can observe here - the main one being, how are they getting in? Are they pretending to be tradespersons and therefore getting through security checks? If so - museum access control should be reviewed. Maybe schedule contractors after  museum hours so that workers can be more closely supervised (unless urgent)?Next - looks like they are attacking prominent pieces. If the real ones are in fact displayed - are they behind climate-controlled plexi barriers (at least)? Is there a security guard next to some of the MOST prominent ones (like the Mona Lisa) to deal with crowd control and preventing people from coming too closely? The issue is that the most famous ones probably ARE protected, but what about the others? and what about the frames and plynths? This is not the first attack on European museums in the last few weeks. Yes - in the past it was more about art theft, but vandalism must definitely be considered.How would you protect artwork?#security #art #securitysystems #accesscontrol #protests #protesters #artwork #consulting #securityaudit

#Brasil - Miles de personas se han concentrado este miércoles frente a las puertas de cuarteles en Sao Paulo, Brasilia y Río de Janeiro, para exigir una «intervención militar» contra la victoria electoral del líder progresista Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Las concentraciones, en las que los manifestantes proclaman que «autorizan» al presidente Jair Bolsonaro a llamar a las Fuerzas Armadas, fueron convocadas a través de las redes sociales por los grupos de ultraderecha que apoyan al gobernante y no reconocen la victoria de Lula en las urnas. Las movilizaciones han sido convocadas paralelas a las protestas de camioneros que bloquean carreteras con el mismo objetivo desde el pasado lunes, aunque esas manifestaciones han perdido fuerza después de que el propio Bolsonaro las desautorizó y determinó que el Gobierno inicie el proceso de transición con el equipo de Lula. La protesta de los camioneros que exigen un golpe militar frente a la victoria electoral de Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva en Brasil, se mantenía este miércoles, pero perdía fuerza en todo el país, según han informado fuentes oficiales. Los bloqueos de carreteras, que llegaron a ser unos 500 en 24 de los 27 estados del país el pasado lunes, habían caído a 167, en los que la policía negociaba con los manifestantes a fin de liberar por completo el tránsito. El movimiento, que reclama una «intervención militar», comenzó a perder intensidad después de que el presidente Jair Bolsonaro, líder de la ultraderecha, terminó de admitir su derrota al determinar que el Gobierno inicie el proceso de transición con el equipo de Lula.De todos modos, pequeños grupos de camioneros mantenían algunos bloqueos, algunos manifestantes hicieron «vigilias» la pasada noche frente a cuarteles del Ejército y han convocado a algunos actos similares para este miércoles, festivo en Brasil por el Día de los Muertos. #latinamerica #protests #demonstrations #politicalrisk #countryrisk #riskmanagement #intelligence

Two Upside-Downs (Commentary): Mondrian & Climate Protestors in Art Museum(s) “The recent discovery that a picture by the Dutch (and, latterly, New York) painter Piet Mondrian has been hanging upside down in the German museum where it has lived for half a century seemed to evoke, nostalgically, an earlier and more predictable era in the polemics of museums and modernism. “Ha, ha! You see?” the wags used to mutter on these occasions. “They can’t even tell which way is up!” And the defenders would feebly mutter fixed avant-gardisms in return.… The Mondrian is doubly potent for us now, since it is called, of all things, “New York City 1,” and comes from the artist’s blissful New York period, which also produced the masterly “Broadway Boogie Woogie” and the “Victory Boogie Woogie”….The controversy over the upside-down Mondrian arrives at a moment when other, not quite companion, controversies about the uses and abuses of art works and the museums in which they sit have been roiling around. A squadron of loosely organized climate-change activists has been entering museums to trash famous pictures, including at least one by Mondrian’s hero, Vincent van Gogh….In the particular case of van Gogh, no human being in the forty thousand years of humanity has ever been more inspired to ecstasy by experienced nature, and none has ever been a humbler companion in the struggles of ordinary people or inclined to ennoble them in art. If the protesters wanted to fall to their knees in reverence before a van Gogh, and then glue their hands to the floor, they might have a cause to make and recruits to add. Making van Gogh the enemy—and no amount of high-stepping rhetoric can make an assault on his pictures somehow apart from an assault on him—is nuts.”https://lnkd.in/eHqV8K4R FROM our group, “Art Museums and Art Galleries: News, Reviews and Collections” ( https://lnkd.in/dweM6GQ ).

Iranian lawmakers demand ‘no leniency’ for protesters as mass demonstrations continueIranian lawmakers have urged the country’s judiciary to “show no leniency” to protesters in a letter cited by state-run Press TV on Sunday, as thousands of people continue to rally on the streets despite the threat of arrest.The Islamic Republic is facing one of the biggest and unprecedented shows of dissent following the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman detained by the morality police allegedly for not wearing her hijab properly.In an open letter signed by 227 of Iran’s 290 members of Parliament, Press TV reports the lawmakers calls for protesters to be taught a “good lesson” to deter others who threaten the authority of the Iranian government.“We, the representatives of this nation, ask all state officials, including the Judiciary, to treat those, who waged war (against the Islamic establishment) and attacked people’s life and property like the Daesh (terrorists), in a way that would serve as a good lesson in the shortest possible time,” the letter read according to state-run Press TV.Lawmakers added that such a punishment – the methods of which were not specified – would “prove to all that life, property, security and honor of our dear people is a red line for this (Islamic) establishment, and that it would show no leniency to anybody in this regard.”Iran has charged at least 1,000 people in Tehran province for their alleged involvement in the nationwide protests over Amini’s death, the largest such show of dissent in years, state news agency IRNA has reported. Their trials are public and have been underway for more than a week.UNICEF United Nations#مهسا_امینی#Mahsa_Amini#people #police #protest #security #property #protests #riot #police #acab #policebrutality #alllivesmatter #politics #nojusticenopeace #justice #tyranny #freedom #wakeup #liberty #communism #dictatorship #newworldorder #government #agenda #nwo #truth #a #socialism #constitution #fakenews #freeyourmind #lies #fightforyourrights #mindcontrol #corruption#jordanpeterson #people #security #property #protests #riot #acab #policebrutality #alllivesmatter #politics #nojusticenopeace #justice #speak #freespeech #fear #fearless #fearofpublicspeaking

#Bolivia - El departamento de Santa Cruz, la mayor región y motor económico de Bolivia, cumple este martes 11 días de paro indefinido por el censo en 2023 desbordada por la acumulación de basura y la escasez de combustible, en medio del cerco de sectores oficialistas que rechazan la huelga. El paro que impulsan los sectores cívicos y el “cerco” que es promovido por grupos que defienden al Gobierno del presidente Luis Arce tienen a Santa Cruz en una situación crítica entre nuevos pedidos de diálogo. En este marco, trascendió que las Fuerzas Armadas de Bolivia fueron convocadas por Arce para participar en el asedio a Santa Cruz. El Gobierno busca que se produzcan choques violentos para justificar la acción del ejército. En ese sentido, en Santa Cruz, los manifestantes temen que los grupos de choque del MAS decidan cortar el suministro de agua y electricidad. En tanto, grupos violentos avanzan desde la zona cocalera de Chapare hacia Santa Cruz. Luis Arce, tomó juramento este martes al nuevo alto mando militar al que pidió defender al Gobierno “legalmente constituido a través de las urnas”, en medio del conflicto por la realización del censo de población que para el oficialismo es un intento de un “golpe de Estado”. Los nuevos jefes militares juraron el cargo en un acto en la casa de Gobierno en La Paz presidido por Arce junto al vicepresidente boliviano, David Choquehuanca, y el ministro de Defensa, Edmundo Novillo. El general de Ejército Hugo Arandia es el nuevo comandante de las Fuerzas Armadas, el contraalmirante Gonzalo Vigabriel es jefe del Estado Mayor, el general Juan José Zúñiga el comandante del Ejército, mientras que la Fuerza Aérea Boliviana (FAB) está a cargo del general Marcelo Zegarra y la Armada Boliviana bajo el mando del contraalmirante Juan Arnez. Según Arce, “hoy Bolivia se encuentra nuevamente amenazada por aquellos que, incapaces de aportar a la democracia, apuestan por la confrontación y la violencia poniendo en peligro la convivencia democrática entre bolivianos” y que “ponen en movimiento una estrategia para reeditar el golpe de Estado de 2019″. #latinamerica #protests #demonstrations #countryrisk #riskmanagement #intelligence

IRAN. Tehran between revolts, enemies and allies In the international chessboard there has been much talk again about Iran. On the one hand the popular demonstrations that have arisen in the aftermath of the killing of Mahsa Amini, the Kurdish girl who symbolised the struggle against the veil. Demonstrations counting over 300 dead and calling for the overthrow of the regime. According to the Al Mayadeen correspondent from 17 November, citing security sources, the rebels began a new phase of actions aimed at inciting an internal armed war in Iran.#agcnews #iran #protests #revolt #security

I have genuine distaste for the actions of the Iranian regime, the inability for those outside the country to not assist the protesters, I really hate that Raisi is blaming these protests on outside influence, and I lothe the fact that no one will face consequences for “314 killed, including 47 minors, and at least 14,170 people have been arrested, including 392 students, in protests in 136 cities and towns, and 134 universities.” #iran #iranprotests2022 # #people #students #universities #protests #protesters #humanrightsviolations #humanrights #regime #violence

On October 25th, Sudanese protestors took to the streets to march against the decision to stop a democratic form of government in Sudan. Sudanese expressed their outrage over the economic crisis that erupted by marching toward the presidential palace in Khartoum. Amidst these protests on the anniversary of the military coup in Sudan, internet services remained blocked until 6 pm. In these protests, the posters in hand had faces of the 116 people who participated in the anti-coup protests and were killed in a crackdown last year.Read the full article here: https://lnkd.in/d7TNm2bH#Sudan, #Economy,  #Military, #Inflation, #Protests, #AntiDemocracy, #Civilians #people

#VoxPopuliIranian protesters set fire to the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini Museum Thursday night in the clearest and most direct act of #defiance against the #regime. Video of the event shows a fire spreading through the museum, which commemorated the founder of the regime and was established in his home after his death. In two clips obtained by Fox News Digital, #people applaud burning the museum, with a woman saying "Great job" after confirming the act. Protests started in mid-September after Iran’s #morality #police arrested 22-year-old Mahsa Amini for allegedly breaching the country’s hijab #laws. They rushed her to the hospital an hour later with what appeared to be injuries sustained from a beating. She died three days later. The regime has struggled to quell the #protests over the past two months, watching almost helplessly as the protests spread to over 140 cities and towns across the country. #Security forces have killed around 350 people and apprehended over 15,000 others, according to #Iran International. A member of the anti-regime group People’s Mujahedin, also known as MEK, told Fox News Digital that #children as young as 10 years old have died due to the actions of the security forces. The regime has indiscriminately attacked the crowds in order to try and dampen the #protests, but they have only appeared to further spur them. The demonstrators have used arson in response to the crackdown, burning down a number of buildings in addition to the Ayatollah museum. On Friday, the protestors set fire to an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps base in Mahabad. The regime even referenced arson as one of its chief causes in choosing to hand down a death sentence this week, as the courts started ordering execution for some protesters – but the act has only further inspired the protesters to continue with their cause. Maryam Rajavi, leader of MEK, said in a statement Thursday that the people have pledged "fire will be reciprocated with fire." "The world witnessed the decisive resolve of the people to overthrow the regime and establish a #democratic republic based on the people’s votes and the separation of religion and the state," Rajavi said. "The oppressors do not have the ability to confront a #nation that has risen up."

Our map of the week highlights protests, demonstrations and strikes throughout Iran sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini in ‘morality’ police custody on 16 September. Major cities, including Tehran, the Kurdistan region, Zahedan in Sistan-Baluchistan province and Mahabad in the West Azerbaijan province have been the major hotspots of daily unrest. Despite the Iranian authorities’ brutal crackdown on protests, demonstrators continue to take to the streets to call for the end of the regime. As a result, the protests have become increasingly violent in recent weeks, with mounting casualties among the protesters and security forces.#iranprotests #Protests #Iran #Police #Security #Protest #Demonstration #CivilUnrest #PoliticalViolence #Risk #VisualizingRisk #Map #Geotagging #RiskMap #RiskMapping #geotag

While the U.S. avoided political violence surrounding last week’s midterm elections, there is still growing concern over the domestic violent extremist landscape, with threats more diverse than at any point in recent memory. Domestic terrorism in the United States has been on the rise the past several years, including a major spike in violent incidents at demonstrations and protests in cities and urban areas.High-profile attacks in 2022 have spanned the ideological spectrum, demonstrating just how complex and unpredictable the state of domestic violent extremism is in the United States currently. Looking ahead, U.S. law enforcement and counterterrorism authorities remain concerned about the radicalizing impact of conspiracies and disinformation, particularly in the area of anti-government and anti-authority violent extremism.Source: The Soufan Center (TSC)https://lnkd.in/eU3iPwpF#extremism #extremists #violentextremism #violence #radicalization #radicalized #terrorism #terrorists #counterterrorism #highthreat #threat #threats #attack #attacks #lawenforcement #publicsafety #domesticterrorism #protest #protests #civilunrest #civildisturbance #unrest #CDU

Thousands took the streets in Iran since the passing of Mahsa Amini highlighting on going struggles faced by Iranians after the 1979 Iranian revolution. Iranians have been protesting across the country for almost 6 weeks, with almost 12,500 arrested. I am part of the panel and will be reflecting upon current developments, the role women are playing, and what the protests mean for the future of women’s rights in Iran.

I appeared on Press TV to discuss the protests in Germany.  Some observations:1.  Two years ago, thousands of German farmers protested against new environmental regulations designed to force them out of business.2.  Last year, the German Green Party received 14.8% of the vote (3rd place).  No party received a majority of the vote.  Imagine trying to form a coalition government with the Green Party.3.  Recently, environmental extremists have been blocking roads because they cannot win elections.  What would you do if a loved one died in an ambulence stuck on the road because of environmental extremists?4.  German businesses have been closing because they cannot afford the electricity bills.  When you lose your job, you have more worries than the increased cost of food.5. Europe lacks sufficient energy resources. Why would they try to end fossil fuel, coal, and nuclear power?  Communist China is expanding its number of coal mines.6.  Why did Germans make with the Russians the Nord Stream pipelines and then provoke the Ukraine War? #Presstv #Germany #Protests #Greenparty #Environmentalextremists #Russia #Nordstream #Ukrainewar #China

#30daymapchallenge #day01 #pointsProtests, world & women⏺️ What’s the point?- In fighting for gender equality- In being a feminist and not ignoring the gender specific problem by wearing an egalitarian hat, and- In raising our voices even in “today’s world” where things seem very advanced and give us an illusion of gender equality...📌This map dashboard shows you what that "point" is!In this visualization the protests involving women from year 2017 till October 7, 2022.

This dashboard still does not include hundreds of the local level protests held by women to fight against political, criminal, health care, corruption-related & economical imbalances.The point is, women are still fighting the wars of gender inequality EVERYWHERE.

An ‘assassination attempt’ on the ousted Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan has been strongly condemned by top inter-governmental bodies including United Nations, Organization of Islamic.The condemnations poured in as PTI chief escaped an apparent assassination attempt on Thursday while leading his anti-government march in Wazirabad.In a statement, the General Secretariat of the top Muslim body, Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), expressed strong condemnation of the assassination attempt.#etribune #news #latest #PTI #ImranKhan #Protests #AssassinationAttempt #pakistan #mediasocial #world #public #us #oic #ksa

The Weapons & Tactics team has written a Security Brief on the violent protests taking place in Chad and the Houti drones attacks on an oil terminal in Yemen. On October 20, Chadian citizens protested in the capital N’Djamena after the president’s son, Mahamat Idriss Deby, announced that elections would be delayed. This will likely lead to more violent government-mandated repression in the future and a likely withdrawal of rebel groups from the peace agreement signed in August.  On October 21, Houthi drones tried to attack an oil terminal in the south of Yemen, but they were intercepted by Yemeni forces and caused no damage to the port. Houtis will likely continue using suicide drones supplied by Iran to attack Yemeni facilities, while in the short term oil importers will very likely avoid Yemeni ports to avoid these attacks.  #Chad #Election #PeaceAccords #Protests #MahamatIdrissDeby #FACT #Rebels #Yemen #UAE #OilIndustry #Houthi #SaudiArabia #Drones #Iranhttps://lnkd.in/ecdHdkz3

It's becoming increasingly clear that the slimy republic is on its way out.As with any regime that is widely reviled and has lost every shred of legitimacy, it is resorting to desperate measures to maintain its elusive grip on the country.At this point in the process, that involves turning on the very people that it claims to be serving.We all know that when tyranny becomes law, revolution becomes a duty.Iranians of all backgrounds have been taking part in the Zan, Zendegi, Azadi (Woman, Life, Freedom) protests for weeks.They want their country back.They want the thugs who have captured the state to take their perverted belief system purporting to be a religion and go.The Iranian Revolution was the last great social experiment of the 20th century and it has failed.On flights out of Iran, women remove their head coverings as soon as the airplane leaves the Iranian airspace.Very few Iranian women wear any sort of head covering or hijab when they are outside Iran.The forced compulsion is an illusion and cannot work.If the nikah mut'ah loving and secretly pork eating adulterers pretending to be pious who have captured the state in Iran know what's good for them, they'll take their perversions and go.The alternative is being crushed by the unstoppable march of history.#motivation #inspiration #strategy #bestadvice #gettingthingsdone #future #politicsandlaw #freedom #freedomofspeech #censorship #authoritarianism #protest #protests #hijab #humanrights #Iran #intolerance #tyranny #revolution #ExUngueLeonem

KEY QUOTE: "#Protests continue, some of which are successful. Separate groups of #conscripts ensured that they were not sent to the front, and some were even sent home. In #Kazan, the rebellious mobilized men threatened the units of the #RussianGuard, which had supposedly been sent in to pacify them. But it is typical that such protests did not take the form of a broad all-Russian movement. Each situation remained local, unrelated to similar protests that were taking place at times just a few kilometres away. The weakness and ineffectiveness of the protests once again revealed the characteristic problem of #Russian society, in which #disunity reigned. Due to the extremely weak social ties and the low level of solidarity, the ability of modern Russians to engage in spontaneous #solidarity actions is minimal, and the authorities have very effectively destroyed all mechanisms of civil coordination. Russian society is like a kind of inert substance, the molecules of which practically do not interact. It remains to be seen if the country will be in this state forever, as the war and mobilization have already changed a lot.But what bodes ill for the authorities is not the dissatisfaction of the lower classes, but the confusion, disunity and mutual claims of the upper classes. #YevgenyPrigozhin, who heads the #WagnerPrivateMilitaryCompany, and the head of #Chechnya, #RamzanKadyrov, have not only created their own private armies, but are also openly at odds with the Russian #military. These two have not only driven the commander of the #CentralGroupOfForces, #GeneralAlexanderLapin, to submit his resignation, but reports of armed skirmishes between the army and the Wagnerites come literally every week. The struggle for Putin’s legacy is already in full swing, and the ruler himself, who has lost his former grip, can only hope to contain these conflicts, not to prevent or resolve them.A political crisis inevitably and naturally follows military failure. It remains only to wait for accumulating, insoluble problems to explode the situation." - Boris KagarlitskyKEY TAKEAWAY: The vultures are circling, awaiting the moment when #VladimirPutin is sufficiently near to death for them to strike. It's not clear whether #Prigozhin, #Kadyrov, #Medvedev or one of the others will assume Putin's mantle, but it seems highly likely to be one of them....#SlavaUkraini Robin Horsfall Yuriy Jexenev 🇪🇺🇪🇪🇰🇿 Tony Sztypuljak Roman Sheremeta Irina Mirochnik Chris Windley Alexandru Nicolin Drake Wauters

A new report from The Intercept  reveals details about the Iranian government’s far-reaching digital #surveillance tools, uncovering how officials partner with mobile carriers to track cell phone users, and monitor, alter, and disrupt their #communications.As #software program imposed on Iranian mobile companies allows the government direct access, SIAM allows mobile operators to track users’ locations and restrict their #data usage.The tools can:𝙨𝙡𝙤𝙬 𝙙𝙖𝙩𝙖 𝙘𝙤𝙣𝙣𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙨𝙗𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙠 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙧𝙮𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 𝙤𝙛 𝙥𝙝𝙤𝙣𝙚 𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙨𝙩𝙧𝙖𝙘𝙠 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙢𝙤𝙫𝙚𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙨 𝙤𝙛 𝙞𝙣𝙙𝙞𝙫𝙞𝙙𝙪𝙖𝙡𝙨 𝙤𝙧 𝙡𝙖𝙧𝙜𝙚 𝙜𝙧𝙤𝙪𝙥𝙨𝙥𝙧𝙤𝙙𝙪𝙘𝙚 𝙙𝙚𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙙 #𝙢𝙚𝙩𝙖𝙙𝙖𝙩𝙖 𝙨𝙪𝙢𝙢𝙖𝙧𝙞𝙚𝙨 𝙤𝙛 𝙬𝙝𝙤 𝙨𝙥𝙤𝙠𝙚 𝙩𝙤 𝙬𝙝𝙤𝙢, 𝙬𝙝𝙚𝙣, 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙬𝙝𝙚𝙧𝙚Such a system could help the government invisibly quash the ongoing #protests — or those of tomorrow — an expert who reviewed the SIAM documents told The Intercept.“SIAM can control if, where, when, and how users can communicate,” explained Gary Miller, a mobile #security researcher and fellow at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab. “In this respect, this is not a #surveillance system but rather a #repression and control system to limit the capability of users to dissent or protest.”#hacktivism #digital #help #university #respect #iran #mobilesecurity #cybersecurity #cyberthreat #humanrights

This is an embarrassing 😳 mistake but it could well be an honest mistake because #HongKong has its own #flag 🇭🇰 but not its own #anthem. If one thinks "logically", s/he would question this and start searching for the "anthem" of the SAR. Many foreigners who do not understand "One Country Two Systems" are rather confused by the #status of Hongkong being part of #China but not always part of China in international events. It has its own #symbols for almost everything from #postalcode (+852), currency (HK$), to its own flag and #passport, but not its own anthem. Those who proposed the 1C2S solution didn't think thoroughly how this entity will actually go #global and be represented abroad in international events like this. Regarding the reactions of the players, the lack of reaction is an reaction itself. But it's not fair to assume that they all know this song because the song has been banned in China and Hong Kong. If these people didn't participate in the #socialmovement or care about the 2019 #protests, how would they know this is a banned anthem of Hongkong? Many #expats did live in a parallel universe back in 2019. I wouldn't be so surprised by their ignorance or innocence. They may even have joined team Hongkong only after 2019, a common practice in international #sports which is a bit silly to be organized by #country still. Apparently, the lawmakers themselves had a much stronger #feeling to the banned song than these players. That's something worth investigating with an interpretivist approach to  #communication #research. #reception #communication #nationalism #internationalsports #anthem #hongkongsar

The Guardian [excerpt]: #Activists who were accused of attempting to “pollute, damage and distort” the Acropolis after they hung a banner from the Athenian monument in #protest against #China’s policies in #Tibet have been acquitted by a Greek court.In a landmark decision described as a victory for #humanrights defenders globally, a three-member tribunal threw out the charge on Thursday. A public prosecutor had only minutes earlier pressed for a guilty verdict.“This is a huge victory for freedom of expression and the right to peaceful protest in #Europe,” said Michael Polak, a barrister at the legal aid group Justice Abroad who had flown in from London for the hearing. “It is also a huge win for the Tibetan and #HongKong people,” he added.While Chinese authorities have previously acted in the belief that they could extend their repression against ethnic and religious groups around the world, said Polak, “the acquittals today will send a strong message that legitimate peaceful protests and assembly, of the type banned totally in #China and Hong Kong, will be allowed even when it hurts the fragile sensibilities of the #Beijing and Hong Kong regimes”.The two student activists, a Tibetan American and Hong Kongese American, had faced up to five years in prison if convicted of a charge viewed as a serious crime under Greek #law.The pair were arrested on 17 October last year as they chanted, “Boycott Beijing 2022” and attempted to drape a Tibetan flag and banner in support of freedom in Hong Kong from scaffolding erected at the site.The following day, three other activists, including a Briton, were detained and held in police custody after briefly disrupting the Olympic flame-lighting ceremony in protest against China holding the Games.They too were charged with attempting to pollute, damage and distort a historical monument after waving a Tibetan flag in front of Chinese officials attending the celebration in ancient Olympia. A trial has been set for 1 December after it was postponed in February amid accusations of proceedings being delayed to avoid embarrassing China on the eve of the Games.#News #sports #protests

Interventions that reduce partisan vitriol don’t help democracy - SkynetLabz

Enlarge / The risk of violence has become a backdrop for protests and polls in the US. It&#8217;s no secret that the US is suffering from a reduced commitment to one of its foundational principles: democratic representation. Gerrymandering, political violence, and unfounded accusations of election fraud are in the news regularly, and the widespread support [&hellip;]

What is the tipping point in creating massive social change?It is much less than you might think.And a flywheel effect of adoption happens after the tipping point is met with the right conditions.Two critical research findings…1) The 25% Rule for Critical Mass towards Social ChangeMost of us think you must reach 51% of the population to get social change. But recent research shows that when 25% of the population holds a minority view that there is a flywheel effect that can happen and at that point, the minority view can affect the majority opinion.See:https://lnkd.in/eTghXekand interpretation of the same:https://lnkd.in/eFi5YQd2) The 3.5% Rule for the Scale of Nonviolent Civil ResistanceA global study of nonviolent protests by researchers found that protest movements that included just 3.5% (or more) of the population were successful at creating change.https://lnkd.in/eaG8e8HFrom the study: “Nonviolent protests are twice as likely to succeed as armed conflicts – and those engaging a threshold of 3.5% of the population have never failed to bring about change.” #socialchange #organizinginspiration #organizing #progressivethinking #nonprofits #nonprofitleadership #climatechange #pluralism #interfaith #interreligious #intercultural #interracial #ngos #ingo #cop27 #cop27egypt #faiths4climate #research #change #civilsociety #protest #protests

🗽 #WelcomeToAmerica ☭ #opinion 🤔America faces a two-front #ideological battle: one at home, one abroad. Victory or defeat on either front will influence the outcome in the other such that any loss is calamitous.Across the battlefield abroad sits the Chinese #Communist Party, waging information warfare dedicated to convincing the world that America is immoral and incompetent to its core. Other authoritarians such as #Russia parrot its assertions. This is part of the CCP’s #strategy to weaken the #UnitedStates and replace us as the strong horse and bend international institutions to its will. America’s willingness to stand as a model of individual #freedom, self-determination, and prospering free enterprise to other countries has been its asset and a cornerstone of the #US-led order. To attempt to draw smaller satellite countries into its orbit, #China seeks to convince them that Uncle Sam has nothing to offer anymore but wokeness, weakness, and #decline.The message is well timed: Americans are fighting among themselves about whether this country and the #globalorder it leads is worth defending. The woke Left doesn’t seem to think so. This is one of the premises of progressive identity #politics. During the Black Lives Matter summer of #protests and #violent #rioting, #activists destroyed businesses and monuments. #Liberal hosts on cable outlets excused the lawless #destruction as morally acceptable due to its “righteous” cause.Elites who hold to this revolutionary framework tell us that math is #racist and that the natural #family and #gender binary are oppressive and bigoted. On Day One in the Oval Office, he signed an executive order “advancing racial equity,” undergirded by the ideas pervasive on the Left that America is an unjust country by design. His most senior Cabinet officials promote the same #message.U.S. #Ambassador to the #UnitedNations Linda Thomas-Greenfield trashed the U.S. in a speech as systemically racist. When the #UN Human Rights Council concluded that the death of George Floyd in #police custody demanded that the U.S. be investigated for #humanrights abuses, Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed the #investigation as something we owed to the #world. And when the Chinese delegation, representatives of a #government running concentration camps, berated Blinken for American racism and human rights abuses, Blinken agreed that “yes, we have work to do.” CCP #propaganda seized on Blinken’s equivocation, splashing across its pages a narrative of the “US’ double #standards in human rights.”This #problem is not contained to the Left.Former President Donald Trump routinely draws a #moral equivalence between the U.S. and #authoritarian countries. He recently did so with a necessary U.S. partner...

THE SERPENT PAPERS is an historical novel, traditionally (not self) published this year, about the complexities of the Vietnam era, which created a rift in our generation. It is nominated for a PEN/HEMINGWAY AWARD.TODAY THIS BOOK IS ON SALE AT AMAZON:$ 9.02 for HARDCOVER$ 9.99 for PAPERBACK$ 7.05 for KINDLEThis book is intended to bring both polar perspectivces of this painful issue- the Vietnam War- to a rapprochement. Although I did protest the war, I have always felt strongly that the boys who fought in Vietnam were patriots, which is why I wrote the book. Major characters include a WWII veteran and a boy who volunteers and goes to VN who is the best friend of the protagonist. My centrist attitudes come through my characters and the pain they feel over the war.When I became a doctor, I ran an intensive care unit in the VA Hospital system for 15 years; I proudly served the veterans for 22 years- full time- in VA hospitals while I was a Professor of Medicine at university. I know the sacrifices our soldiers made in Vietnam- again, those who fought were patriots. They did not make the decisions about whether the nation should fight in Vietnam, and they are not guilty of creating that war.The Foreword to the book, THE SERPENT PAPERS, was written by a decorated Vietnam combat veteran who said the book was "the best book I have read in the last 10 years."Another veteran who served in Vietnam for 1000 days and who was extremely decorated loved the book [Recipient of 3 Purple Hearts & 2 Bronze Stars, Army Commendation Medal with "V" Device with 3 Oak Leaf Clusters, Air Medal, Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with Gold Palm Award, Meritorious Service Medal; US Army, 1st Infantry & Americal Divisions; Vietnam, 1966-67, 68-69, 70-71 (served 1000 days)]. Other reviews of The Serpent Papers have been superb: CHESAPEAKE STYLE MAGAZINE REVIEW:“The Serpent Papers is a tour de force, intimate, fast paced, can’t-put-it-down adventure""I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT THIS BOOK"-THE JEWISH NEWS"SCHNADER'S WRITING IS MULTI-SENSUAL & POWERFUL"-NEW YORK JOURNAL OF BOOKS"AUTHENTIC, INTENSE TALE OF COMING OF AGE IN VIETNAM ERA"-RICHMOND TIMES-DISPATCH“IT IS SO WELL WRITTEN IT IS PARALLEL TO SHAKESPEARE...

Using LinkedIn as a true source of communication. I am speaking on behalf of all the women in Iran. All I need your support to share this message.you might heard or saw some bad news from my country, #iran regarding the #protests and #mahsaamini. Security forces in #iran murdered a 22-year-old #mahsaamini , who was detained for violating the country's dress code… (not having mandatory #hijab )Iranian police said #mahsaamini died of a heart attack and released footage purportedly showing the moment she collapses.Let me say something here: THIS IS A LIE. I lived my whole life in that country. I have been punished many times by morality police for not having my scarf appropriate enough to cover all my hair whether it was in the university (in front of everyone) or it was pulled over by Police!So far, at least 5 people were killed, 75 were injured and over hundreds were arrested till today (in only 4 days). This numbers are raising. They are waiting for the president to return from #unitednations of #newyorkThe current protest in Iran is not only because of #hijab , it has a long story of not giving value to people's life, no human rights, stealing money from the governmental budget, imprisoned many journalists many innocent civilians and many more…Over and over, the Islamic Republics have erased every ounce of trust left among 83 million citizens.I am asking my Networks to help and support Iranian people who are fighting with bare hands in front of the gunshots, tears gas, batons, knifes, pepper sprays, etc. by sharing these messages, Like, comment or hashtag  and shed some lights from the international supports. All we need is an international support to be our voice, to support people who are in the streets RIGHT NOW, and no one knows if they will be back to their home by the end of the day! NetBlocks just confirmed access to Instagram, WhatsApp, one of the LAST available social media platforms in #iran , has been restricted. Consequence is: simple : people will die or imprisoned without being heard and seen because of no access ...

Vladimir Kara-Murza, one of the best knows #Russian #opposition #leaders, has been imprisoned in #Russia on charges of high treason this April, and since then his wife Evgenia has not been allowed to talk to him❗Vladimir is a sworn opponent of Putin and an outspoken critic of #RussianWar in #Ukraine. The treason charge against him is based on three speeches abroad, including one in which Vladimir said that in Russia #political opponents were persecuted. Russian investigators maintain that he was speaking on behalf of the #US-based Free Russia Foundation, which is banned in Russia, where any "consultancy" or "assistance" to a foreign organization is now considered a #nationalsecurity #threat and can be interpreted as treason.But in a series of letters to Sarah Rainsford, BBC News foreign correspondent, from Detention Centre No. 5, Vladimir - who has twice been the victim of a mysterious poisoning - says he has no regrets, because the "price of silence is unacceptable"❗"We all understand the risk of opposition activity in Russia. But I couldn't stay silent in the face of what's happening, because silence is a form of complicity," Vladimir explains in a letter from his cell.He felt he could not stay abroad either. "I didn't think I had the right to continue my political activity, to call other people to action, if I was sitting safely somewhere else."#Russians #persecution #protests #Moscow #Kremlin #agression #Western #sanctions #security #risks #future #hopeforthebest

Narco test not enough in Delhi’s Shraddha murder case.The Delhi Police have arrested Aftab Ameen Poonawala in connection with the Shraddha Walkar murder case. Aftab strangulated her on May 18 and then chopped her body into 35 pieces. The Delhi Police says it wants at least one more week’s custody of the 28 year old to complete its investigations and gather all evidence. He has been in custody for five days. Though parts of her body have been found in Mehrauli near the couple’s apartment in Chhatarpur, her severed head which Aftab allegedly kept in a fridge for days-is missing. The Police have Aftab’s confession, forensic reports of Shraddha’s body parts & the transaction details of Rs.54,000 that Aftab pulled put from Shraddha’s account. A Narco test permission has been sought to estimate the underlying cause and intention behind the heinous murder. The six month old murder trial depends on forensic reports, call data and circumstantial evidences only. ...#delhi #police #aftab #shraddha #walkar #couple #dating #mumbai #killing #protests #outrage #justice #internet #murder #victim #convicts #investigation #mehrauli #news #media #india #instagram #politics #journalism #press #magazine #breakingnews #latestnews #newsupdate #nation
