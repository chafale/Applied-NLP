You can't write a book about general DEI and not talk about racism, racial injustice, and the racial movements that led to the establishment of DEI as a field. That's a failure and erases the contributions of Black people and people of color. #DEI #racism

Exactly - I‚Äôve led many organizational, regional, southern, and national conversations regarding this. Health equity is not just about black and brown people or only black and brown people getting what they need to be whole and achieve their best health. It‚Äôs about people, especially vulnerable, socially, or historically disadvantage populations (i.e., people who are poor, people who are brown and black, people with disabilities, people in rural communities, people who are LGBTQ, people who are unhoused, etc., etc.) getting what they need to achieve their best health or achieve their best wellbeing.
-----------------------------
This is not new. I feel like we are regressing instead of moving forward. I started my career in healthcare and public health. When the conversation about health disparities began in the late 90s we knew then that racism was the cause. In the seminal work Unequal Treatment, the Institute of Medicine discusses the primary factors of which systemic racism is the cause of decreased health outcomes. The crux of the issue is summed up in this sentence from the book. Even when educated or at a higher socioeconomic level, Blacks and other racial ethnic groups are sicker and die sooner. #publichealth #health #healthcarejobs #medicine #racialequity #racialjustice #racism ##diversityandinclusion ##healthdisparities #aamc #iom #unequaltreatment #briansmedley #adriennestith

I get some weird messages in my Linked In DMs sometimes.Mostly involving a strange lack of punctuation that as a writer I find irritating.As a woman, I also get the odd proposition, but having watched a lot of Catfished, I generally dismiss those as scammers.But what I don't receive are the kinds of messages my Black and brown connections do, especially if they post the truth of their experiences as Black and brown people.I (occasionally) have written posts about racism, equity, etc.I've never received hate DMs.You want to know why?You know why. We all know why. Just take a quick look at my profile pic.It's incredibly important for those of us who are white/male/het/privileged to realize we exist in a very different social media climate from those who don't look like us.And that it might even be a hostile environment for them.We white people can help firstly by acknowledging this different reality and not covertly gaslighting anyone's experiences.Bullying wears different masks, and it often wears the mask of self-righteousness when attacking Black and brown folks. See it for what it is.Block the bullies, report them, make it clear it's not acceptable, and show your support for the person being bullied.And most importantly, if you're white, listen and validate the experiences being shared and learn to support in the ways Black and brown people are asking us to.#equityandinclusion #socialmedia #racism

One of my drivers "Jarek" (a nickname, not his real name ... to protect his identity) was attacked in broad daylight yesterday. Set about in Hull. His crime? Because he is Polish. He tells me he sees hatred and suffers abuse daily. And all because of his nationality.This guys one of the most timid, gentle, funny and decent blokes I know. As his line managers line manager, he's incredibly hard working. And so customer focused. As a delivery driver the customers on his route love him. This is a guy that supports his customers by calling them when he's home on holiday in Poland  Ensuring the service his annual leave stand in is giving is as they expect. And his customers remain happy. Some customers have client specific places we deliver to. So this guy will coach his stand in, often in his own time, so his customers never see a drop in delivery standards.In 2022 its sickening to think there's hatred and racism on every street corner. And good guys like Jarek have to suffer this in our supposed civilised society. As they go about their everyday business. Trying simply to get by.Jarek suffers from poor mental health from time to time. I try to support him day by day. Checking in with him, supporting him. Simply finding him a few minutes every week. Giving him a platform to discuss his health, his problems, his concerns. Both personally & professionally. A coffee with him once a week that's all.I hope these bullies don't win. And my hope for Jarek is he gets to live his life without hatred. For merely being a different nationality.This good guy didn't deserve this! I hope the police catch the pond life that did this .... I really do and I've messaged him this morning so he knows support isn't there just in working hours (but conscious I don't take every work problem home too ... but these are exceptional ... and very sad times) #health #mentalhealth #racism #society #love

Hundreds of thousands of Nepalis were part of an army of migrant workers who remade Qatar for the World Cup, doing dangerous work in the searing heat.The system that exploits their labor and their desperation has cost thousands of them their lives. Qatar has a long history of #racism , #sexism, #homophobia and one of the only reasons why World Cup is being hosted there is because there is zero accountability how money is spent under authoritarian regimes. This is not a democracy so when we make statements like below; we are not bringing ‚Äújustice‚Äù, we are further ignoring and justifying the injustices that are deep in the systems of authoritarian regimes of the ‚ÄúEast‚Äù.***FIFA President Gianni Infantino said Western criticism of Qatar is "profoundly unjust" and that "what we Europeans have been doing for the last 3,000 years, we should be apologizing for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons."

There are so many things wrong with this, but I'd just like to point out that this young woman thinks that among the things wrong with  her father, he was a "cis straight white man."She says he was a "racist" (I doubt it, but that would be bad if true) and was "Trump loving" (nothing wrong with that).

The Khampepe Report - which investigated allegations of racism at Stellenbosch University - was released on 8 November 2022. It refers to the culture of fear and hierarchical decision-making at the university which undermine transformation.

I absolutely agree Betty Taylor. Qld needs a dedicated Domestic and Sexual Violence Commissioner overseen by the Premier and Attorney General. The focus has to be on action, moving forward, not scape-goating  or deflecting the depth and seriousness of the problem. There are systemic culture failures driven by misogyny and racism deeply entrenched in the QPS, as in so many other police agencies, which were never designed 'fit for purpose' for policing #DV and #SV. Historically all male agencies focused on public law and order crimes. My view, backed by abundant research evidence, is that Police cannot be expected to act alone as the only first responders to #DFV & #SV. They must work in multi-disciplinary teams with trauma informed social workers, counsellors, investigators, lawyers etc. Bravo to all the courageous #QPS officers like Kate, who spoke up, many of whom at the peril of their careers. #COI #QldPolice #DV #SV #Misoygny #Racism

WOULD MALAYSIA ENTER A NEW ERA OF POLITICAL STABILITY? Malaysia‚Äôs 2022 General Elections (GE15) have many pleasant surprises.¬†For the first time, it did not produce a clear-cut Parliamentary majority for any political party, as was the case in the past with Barisan National (BN) and its component parties of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), Malaysian Chinese Alliance (MCA), and the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC).¬†In GE15, the final Parliamentary seats won so far are as follows: ¬†¬†¬†(BN) Barisan Nasional (30 seats)(PN) Perikatan Nasional (73 seats)(PH) Pakatan Harapan (81 seats)(GPS) Gabungan Parti Sarawak (33 seats)(GRS) Gabungan Rakyat Sabahand Others.¬†PN Chief Muhyiddin Yassin, a long-time political veteran who was appointed as Prime Minister by the King after the collapse of the PH Government in August 2020, but was ousted after only 17 months, is expected to become the next Prime Minister if and when a Coalition Government is agreed among PN+BN+GPS+GRS=136 seats to give a comfortable working majority in the 222-seat Parliament. The political turmoils of 2020 caused by defecting Members of Parliament (MPs) to other political parties would not happen this time, given the new Anti-Hopping Law that mandates re-election if any MP quits or jump parties. ¬†The defections resulted in the collapse of the historic 2018 PH Government in 2020.¬† PH under the leadership of former Deputy Prime Minster Anwar Ibrahim, when Mahathir was the Prime Minister, is not expected to be able to muster the support of other more moderate political parties, especially from Sabah and Sarawak, to form a coalition. ¬†A downside of GE15 is that the fundamentalist Islamic Parti Islam (PAS), as a component of PN, now has the largest number of 49 MPs. This is however outnumbered by other more multi-racial political parties in BN as well as the DAP in PH.¬†Extreme racial-based politics is therefore unlikely, especially given the utter rejection of former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir who is the main instigator of racial tensions during his 24 years in the post. Mahathir, who is a minority ethnic Indian, suffers a resounding and decisive GE15 defeat, winning barely 10% of votes after 53 years as MP, where he also lost his candidate deposit, which should also mark the end of his political life.¬†It heralds the beginning of a more multi-racial approach in politics with greater inter-racial respect and tolerance. ¬†A new era of political stability in Malaysia has therefore emerged to nurture a more nationalistic, multiracial, and pro-Malaysian development agenda.

Muslims are simply people believing in a God other than yours.Christians are simply people believing in a God other than yours.Black people are simply people with ancestors born somewhere in Africa.White people are simply people with ancestors born somewhere is Eurasia.Gay people are simply people with homosexual orientation.Straight people are simply people with heterosexual orientation.I don't feel neither superior nor inferior to you because I believe or don't believe in a God under a certain name, or because my ancestors were born in a certain place, or because my sexual orientation is what it is. And frankly, I don't care if or in what God you believe in, where your ancestors were born, or what your sexual orientation is.That's the real Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion.If you wish to demonstrate that you believe in a God under a certain name, or that your ancestors were born at a certain place, or you have a certain sexual orientation, that is - whether you like it or not - #racism. And yes, minorities are not at all immune to racism.Believing in a God under a certain name is not an achievement to be proud of. Having ancestors born in a certain place is not an achievement to be proud of either. Let alone having a certain sexual orientation. You didn't achieve any of those things, so you can be proud of your achievements. I could easily be in your place, and you in mine.So, cut the #DEI crap, and start respecting people about what they do (or don't do), not about who they are.

I am reposting this with additional comments. I was just trolled for siding with FIFA and #qatar and not caring about #humanrights.  The 99.9% of those usual suspects who are demanding to boycott Qatar Football Worldcup have never visited that country and citing the deaths of immigrant workers from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal etc. as why Qatar should not hold a football world cup. My question to all these critics is, since when did you start caring about the lives of Pakistanis or any other immigrant worker - whether in Pakistan or elsewhere? And what do you know about them?Seriously, ironical also - since football itself is a legacy of colonial occupations in a world it still largely enslaves. But whether it is the Australian Open, Olympics, Wimbledon ... it is incredible that lobbies convert every global sporting event into a clash of ideologies, policies or political conflicts rather than the sports itself. .No one society, or ethnicity, in the world today has a right to be the moral police or hold the gold-standard on the fight against #racism,  lack of #inclusion, misogyny, freedom to choose or even LGBTQ rights. No one country can claim to be the ultimate champions of #humanrights. Hypocrisy and double standards are rampant in today's world.   It is everywhere - sometimes better veiled and "beautifully" systemic. But this world collectively suffers injustice and too much because of wars, hate and #intolerance.I fully support the country of Qatar and wish them the very best of success - not only for themselves but for the game of #football - the most inclusive of #team #sports in the world. Let's for a change allow a Middle Eastern country to be themselves ... to prove and grow ... let them succeed. Please.In the words of the FIFA chief. "Let's celebrate, don't divide."  Let's enjoy Football.

For those with whom the original post by Daniel Abrahams resonates and has resonated, please feel free to order ‚ÄúEveryday Stuggle: How Toxic Workspaces Impact Black Women.‚ÄùYou can order it here:https://lnkd.in/g67zTtSiIn this book, my chapter ‚ÄúSilence of the Soil,‚Äù defines and addresses the following #corporatehatecrimes:1. #ageism 2. #harassment  (white women against black women‚Ä¶yeah it ain‚Äôt just a sexual thing and it ain‚Äôt just the fellas ladies! HR, rewrite that #harrassment  policy thing please! The definition has taken on a whole nutha meaning !)3. #racism 4. #microagression5. #gaslighting 6. #tonepolicingThis short but to the point chapter is a synopsis of my full story about my 1st experience with #systemicracism  in #corporateamerica  at the hands of two women who made my life living hell when I decided to #help  my #singlemother  US Army daughter who was stationed at the time in #Okinawa, to rear her 14-month old son (my first grandchild) by myself as a single grandmother here on American soil so she could focus on advancing her Army #militarycareer while in #Japan. That‚Äôs a whole nutha story you can read in the anthology: ‚ÄúHer War Too.‚ÄùAvailable on Amazon:https://lnkd.in/gRzB6ktSThese women committed every #corpratehstecrime I write about in ‚ÄúEveryday Struggle!‚ÄùFor the full story, read ‚ÄúShut‚ÄôEm Down: Black Women, Racism and Corporate America.‚Äù  You can order it here:https://lnkd.in/dCtcQZUBut know this: my story ended with a 48-hour resignation notice and me wearing a tee-shirt on my last day that read:WE OUT!~Harriet Tubman, 1849And for those of you who want out of your current toxic #workspace, never worry about ‚Äúburning bridges‚Äù by not giving 2-weeks notice if you decide to ##resign! An employer wouldn‚Äôt give you that courtesy if they plan to #fire  you. Working in ‚Äúat will‚Äù states works both ways my friend! You can fire your #employer  before they fire you and by the way, the minute you feel the shift from being a stellar employee in their eyes to them documenting and discussing your #faults, they are making their case against you, trust me!Oh and by the way, THERE IS NO BRIDGE!That part!I‚ÄùM HERE FOR YOU WHOEVER YOU ARE!

When will the UK join the USA? Brexit, https://lnkd.in/eqbvANEU, was the prelude for the UK joining the American Union---post 1776, Canada, the USA, and UK a trade block-- the USD will join the Pound for the global stable currency, the joining will occur, we believe, under King William--we believe the plans are being put in place now. The Pound appears to be a dying currency now that Brexit is the law in the UK.

There is a serious surge in racism toward "white people" in the united states and the longer people stay quite about it, the worse it's going to be.For whatever reason, speaking against this issue seems to be un-politically correct.Thats how hatred that leads to genocide cultivates.You can see this racism for yourself by searching the words "white people" on every social media app, LinkedIn included.#racism #socialmedia

I had the honor of helping her with this important book and really want the world to read this one.  She is a true Healthcare Firestarter.The book includes stories and research of how bias affects both patients and healthcare providers. It examines bias based on race, gender, weight, disabilities, age, poverty religion, science, and education.  It also makes very pragmatic recommendations on what can be done by all stakeholders.The book will be released on March 28th. If you would like to preorder, have Dr. Marshall as a speaker, or interview her for media, please go to https://lnkd.in/g-CspB3WIf you are an influencer in any of the biases listed above or in healthcare, please contact me for an advanced reader copy. #education #healthcare #science #bias #patientengagement #doctors #research #newbook #gender #ageism #racism #abelism

Is it racism to call out racism?What is _your_ definition of "racism"?Now go ask someone else what is their definition.I believe we must name oppression, call it out, blunt it, ridicule it, kick it to the curb, and celebrate when it slinks back under its rock.If you disagree, please explain why you support oppression.Here's a little ditty that I like sing upon occasion:If you're racist and you're fired , it's your fault.If you're racist and you're fired , it's your fault.If you're racist and you're fired , you should never have been hired.If you're racist and you're fired , it's your fault.#ethics #diversityequityinclusion #racism #ethicaleadership

FTA:  ‚ùó From 1937 to 1948, more than a hundred lawsuits sought to evict African American residents from neighborhoods with Whites-only deed covenants. In 1947, a man was jailed for refusing to move out of a home he bought in violation of one such covenant.‚ùó  In 1943, the all-White community of Culver City recruited World War II air raid wardens to circulate documents seeking commitments not to sell or rent homes to African Americans.‚ùó From 1949 to 1953, the Federal Housing Administration financed Whites-only housing projects in Lakewood, Westchester and Panorama City.‚ùó  In 1954, Los Angeles routed the Santa Monica Freeway through Sugar Hill,¬†the city‚Äôs most prosperous African American middle-class community, culminating an unsuccessful 16-year effort to keep Blacks from moving there.Southern California News Group Los Angeles Daily News Orange County Register #housing #racism #antiracism #urbanplanning #realestate #white

A escravid√£o come√ßava pelo esquecimento da humanidade do povo negro. E o racismo se mant√©m at√© hoje pelo esquecimento do processo que nos formou como na√ß√£o. O Brasil foi o √∫ltimo pa√≠s a abolir a escravid√£o nas Am√©ricas.Ainda hoje, existe um racismo silencioso e c√∫mplice, que se expressa nas oportunidades negadas √† maioria do povo pela cor da pele. O racismo √© filho do √≥dio e da intoler√¢ncia e desumaniza a todos n√≥s. E por isso √© uma luta de todos.O 20 de novembro, dia da Consci√™ncia Negra, data da morte de Zumbi dos Palmares, marca uma triste p√°gina do Brasil que n√£o podemos esquecer. Mas tamb√©m recorda a luta do povo negro por sua liberta√ß√£o.Se quisermos um futuro de justi√ßa e democracia, precisamos ser antirracistas.

WARNING: THIS PODCAST CONTAINS THOUGHT PROVOKING CONVERSATION.My chat with top fashion designer Jatin Patel is packed full of meaty chunks - it was recorded the day after #rishisunak became PM, and Jatin has some really interesting stuff to say around being #British #Indian, growing up in the 70s & 80s, #racism and and only now feeling able to fully be himself. We also talk about ethics and #sustainability in the #fashion industry and how standing up for what you believe in can be a difficult, if ultimately more rewarding path. And we talk about his love of #Medway in #Kent - he is a Medway Champion, his business is based there, and he is hugely ambitious to see the full #creative potential of the area unleashed. He's a thoroughly interesting and engaging person to talk with, and I recommend you take a listen. Unless you don't like thought provoking conversation.#podcast

"I never heard of colorism before."My daughter, Analisa Writes, in her book "Little Oak," tackles a topic unfamiliar to many.  As I share the book's topic with many, I continue to hear people say this over and over. For example, some think colorism refers to differences in hair color (red versus blond) or eye color (brown versus green).Colorism is the belief, among some ethnic groups worldwide, that the lighter a person's skin color, the more acceptable they become. Although it was born out of racism, colorism is a different social construct.Teaching your children about colorism and our nation's complex history does not teach them to "hate" America.  Instead, educating all children about our shared history as Americans expands their curious, forgiving, and growing minds. This helps them better understand the different perspectives and experiences of others ‚Äîand provides insight into how they show up not only as children but later on as adults.At the end of the book, I offer a message to parents and guardians explaining this construct and tips for talking about colorism with children and, who knows, maybe even other adults!Purchase your copy today to learn more:AnalisaWrites.com: https://lnkd.in/gc6yNdnhand on Amazon:https://lnkd.in/gCiK6fxgAnalisa Writes #truth #American #colorism #racism #teach #history #racism #love#nohate #acceptance #understanding #perspectives

Folks, it‚Äôs official: racism ruins your life.The following is an example.One evening, Tan Boon Lee was walking down Orchard Road. He saw Dave Parkash with his girlfriend, Jacqueline Ho. Both are mixed-race Singaporeans.Tan didn‚Äôt know them. That didn‚Äôt stop him from accosting Parkash and saying that an Indian man should not be with a Chinese girl.Turning to Ho, Tan told her that her parents would be disgraced as she was dating an Indian man.Parkash posted a video of the confrontation, saying, ‚ÄúLove is love. Love has no race, love has no religion. You and I should be able to love whoever we wanna love.‚ÄùThe video went viral. Singapore reacted with the classic 3 stages of Singaporean outrage.Stage 1 (Condemnation): citizens and political leaders criticised Tan's behaviour.Stage 2 (Doxxing): keyboard sleuths identified Tan as a lecturer at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. The polytechnic dismissed Tan, citing a breach of its Code of Conduct.Stage 3 (Complaints): Tan posted an apology. But by then, the police were already investigating him. As it turns out, some 64 obscene videos were found on Tan‚Äôs phone.Eventually, Tan landed up in court. He admitted to one count of wounding an individual‚Äôs racial feelings and another of possessing obscene films. Two other charges were taken into consideration.Seeking 4 weeks‚Äô jail, Deputy Public Prosecutor Yeow Xuan said, ‚ÄúThe racist remarks made were vile and sustained ‚Äì the accused repeatedly told Dave that he should ‚Äòmarry an Indian‚Äô, stated that he was ‚Äòpreying‚Äô on Chinese girls and even called Dave a ‚Äòdisgrace‚Äô and ironically, a ‚Äòracist‚Äô.‚ÄùTan engaged experienced lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam to defend him.Thuraisingam said that when Tan encountered Parkash and Ho, Tan had something weighing on his mind. Tan's own daughter dated someone of a different race, and Tan objected to it. That's why Tan acted as he did.Principal District Judge Victor Yeo will sentence Tan on 29 December.I draw 4 conclusions from this saga.1.¬†Singapore is a work in progress. By and large, we're a successfully multiracial society. But it‚Äôs also true that there are racists among us. I guess they will always be there.2.¬†Having said that, the vast majority of us are not racists, and will call out racism. That's clear from the huge backlash against Tan.3. If you keep obscene videos in your phone, don‚Äôt go out of your way to make racist statements to strangers. It won‚Äôt end well. Stick to one crime at a time.4. Racism has consequences. As a racist, you form stereotyped views of diverse groups of human beings. You believe some races are better than others. You judge everyone through the lens of race: your colleagues, your neighbour, your daughter's boyfriend. This prevents you from seeing humans as unique individuals. You shut yourself off from beneficial relationships.You end up becoming the biggest victim of your racism.Racism ruins your life. That's the saddest conclusion of all.#racism #criminallaw #society

As people enter and progress up an organisation, they deserve to get the right amount of pay. A recent study by IFS states that there is: ‚ÄòClear evidence‚Äô of discrimination in terms of salary and careers despite academic progress, from Black, Asian and ethnically diverse talent. Most continue to earn less than their white British counterparts, and all earn less on average than expected given their education, background and occupation.¬†Despite the importance of fair and equitable pay, the ethnicity pay gap remains a common issue in majority white countries. Essentially, it‚Äôs the difference between how much your average white employee in any given profession makes, versus the average employee of a non-white ethnicity.Black, Asian and other ethnically diverse groups are continuously penalised by societal structures. Over the last few years the pressures of austerity have also had a huge impact and now the cost of living crisis will add to this. What can people / organisations do to push for progress to combat this? ‚úÖ Voluntarily disclose your ethnicity pay gap, as this can play a key role in assessing if and where inequalities exist in your workforce.‚úÖ Pay candidates fairly: If a candidate asks for less than your budget, give them your budget. Close the pay gap. ‚úÖ Be their cheerleader. When salary or bonus discussions are happening advocate for them in those rooms and at those tables that can‚Äôt be in. Please do the same when it comes to conversations on performance ratings and promotions as well. ‚úÖ Invest in effective management training:¬† Managers play a key role in engaging and retaining talent for your business. Biases affect us all so investing in proper diversity training and developing soft skills like emotional intelligence is absolutely essential.‚úÖ Take financial wellbeing seriously: Develop a financial wellness programme that helps protect employees from financial shocks. ‚úÖ Review the pay of your team/employees, see if they are in-line with each other and what the going rate is for their role in the industry. Currently, Black, Asian and ethnically diverse talent in the workforce‚Äôs educational success is not reflected in pay, this has got to change. What other things should organisations and individuals be doing to make meaningful change so people are paid correctly?¬†#education #success #racism #discrimination #diversity #inclusion

What some white people don‚Äôt seem to understand about some Black people and other people of color leaving Twitter: This is not about avoiding disagreement. Whether you agree with me is not my concern. I don‚Äôt expect everyone to agree with me. Or share my politics. Or believe what I believe‚Äîon Twitter or anywhere. I appreciate the fact that human beings are different. Our lived experiences shape our world views, and that‚Äôs part of what makes life interesting. My concern is safety. Some of you read the need for ‚Äúsafety‚Äù as soft or weak or overly sensitive. But that‚Äôs because you are already safe. You can freely live, work, shop, and be entertained in most spaces without having to wonder if you will be disregarded, disrespected, insulted, or threatened because of your skin color‚Äîbefore anyone knows your name or who you are or what you do. You never feel ‚Äúpleasantly surprised‚Äù when people who meet you for the first time treat you with dignity. You expect to be treated that way because most times, you are. There‚Äôs a lot we‚Äîpeople who are not white‚Äîcan‚Äôt control. (That‚Äôs a story for another day.) So we create safety where we can to protect our minds and hearts and preserve the bit of wellness we have left in a society that insists on keeping its foot on our necks at work, in hospitals, in schools, in civil and financial matters, and in the streets. Disagree with me all day. But taunting and verbal violence?BLOCKED. CANCELLED. DEACTIVATED.

I started Newkind Conference back in 2017 because I wanted to create an event and build a growing network of people who were just as obsessed as me about improving the rate and the efficacy of "changemaking" efforts and social change initiatives. If you've ever felt that you wanted to "get to the point" or address social, environmental and economic issues "at the root cause" well then, you'll likely enjoy the conversations that happen at Newkind very much.We started this as a 3-day festival-style event, with music, entertainment, meals and beach-side camping, (and cold showers) and over the years we've had many styles and iterations of the conference  both in Tasmania, and Melbourne, that have each served their purpose.This year we are lucky enough to have sponsorship from Jobsbank Australia the support of RMIT University with the use of the Capitol Theatre, for a jam-packed 2 days of discussion panels on the themes of Gender Equality, Race Equity, Economic Justice, Climate Action, Sovereignty and Treaty, and Employment, Inclusion and Representation.If you, your organisation or department work in any area where you work directly with serving people, including environment, economics, settlement & migration, gender equality, education, health, social enterprise, homelessness and poverty alleviation, violence prevention, First Nations sovereignty, climate justice, diversity & inclusion, or literally ANY space that seeks to create a positive impact in the world, then you need to join us at Newkind Social Justice Conference.We've extended the early bird rate, to ensure financial accessibility, and we're giving out discount codes and sponsored tickets left, right and centre to ensure anyone who wants to learn, connect, grow, network, get inspired, is able to join us no matter what. So if you can make it, book a ticket now at www.newkindconference.com and if you need a ticket, just message me, please.We need to imagine, design and build a new kind of world that is just, equitable, regenerative, inclusive, united and prosperous for all.So join me next week on Monday 21st and Tuesday 22nd for Newkind!#inclusion #diversity #gender #economics #education #people #health #justice #climatechange #regenerative #settlement #racism #equity #socialchange #NewkindConference

So my recruiter prefers to let me know that I would have been better off as a white since everyone in the room was. According to her I had a big head, a fat nose, and a hair texture she didn't like, and it didn't matter if I was light skinned.Without having a single evaluation on my skills and experiences, she told me I can't be on her team, her loss! I am honestly marveled at the guts because I am very sure if she had met me face to face, she wouldn't be able to ask me what the time is. üî∑This is a public announcement to my intending recruiters who might have personal problems with people's races, as you can see my head is very big, my nose is fat, my hair might pass for a jean, none of this will change! üî∑Enough of giving the dishonors of racism to the inability of an individual to make use of their frontal lobe.

Em 2011, foi institu√≠do o Dia Nacional de Zumbi e da Consci√™ncia Negra, reconhecendo o valor simb√≥lico do 20 de novembro, escolhido por ser o dia da morte de Zumbi, l√≠der do Quilombo dos Palmares e refer√™ncia na resist√™ncia contra a escravid√£o.  E por que √© importante falar de migra√ß√£o no dia da Consci√™ncia Negra? Justamente porque a imagem do Brasil como uma democracia racial e uma terra acolhedora n√£o se sustenta se olharmos para seu passado escravagista, assim como para muitos migrantes negros que chegam ao pa√≠s hoje em dia.   O nosso maior problema n√£o √© a xenofobia, e sim o racismo. No per√≠odo p√≥s-escravid√£o, o Brasil enxergou nos migrantes brancos a esperan√ßa de nos tornarmos uma na√ß√£o mais ‚Äúbranca‚Äù. Est√° a√≠ a vincula√ß√£o entre migra√ß√£o e negritude na quest√£o racial brasileira.  O cientificismo eugenista do final do s√©culo XIX consistia em promover a imigra√ß√£o europeia, que substituiria a m√£o de obra escrava ao mesmo tempo em que ajudaria no ‚Äúembranquecimento‚Äù populacional. A estrat√©gia civilizat√≥ria, ocidental, cat√≥lica e branca passaria por uma sele√ß√£o criteriosa de quem era desej√°vel ao Brasil.  Inclusive existe uma pesquisa do professor Ousmane Power-Greene, da Clark University (EUA), que relata que, no in√≠cio da d√©cada de 1920, um grupo de americanos negros decidiu deixar para tr√°s a viol√™ncia e o racismo nos Estados Unidos e come√ßar uma nova vida no Brasil. Atra√≠dos por an√∫ncios publicados pelo governo brasileiro em jornais do exterior, os americanos esperavam encontrar um "para√≠so racial", onde n√£o havia preconceito e todos tinham oportunidades.  Mas, quando o governo brasileiro ficou sabendo que esse grupo de imigrantes era formado por pessoas negras, houve uma mobiliza√ß√£o para impedir sua entrada no pa√≠s, e o assunto passou a dominar debates na imprensa e no Congresso.  Preocupados em manter a imagem de "democracia racial", que era cultivada pelo Brasil com orgulho, defensores do veto alegaram que os americanos n√£o estavam sendo rejeitados por serem negros, mas sim porque poderiam perturbar a ordem p√∫blica. A motiva√ß√£o n√£o seria, portanto, racial, e sim de seguran√ßa nacional.  Os brasileiros com antepassados brancos ou asi√°ticos se orgulham do pai espanhol, do bisav√¥ alem√£o ou japon√™s. Inclusive se orgulham de manter suas tradi√ß√µes. Mas os afro-brasileiros n√£o conhecem suas origens porque esses registros foram apagados e suas culturas foram esmagadas. Isso √© uma ferida aberta.  No Brasil, o racismo √© estrutural. Por isso, √© preciso estabelecer um recorte racial em todas as rela√ß√µes. √â necess√°rio compreender que mesmo o africano de classe m√©dia que chega ao Brasil para cursar um mestrado ouvir√° coisas que um europeu com as mesmas caracter√≠sticas n√£o ter√° que ouvir. H√° o peso da hist√≥ria sobre nossos ombros e elucidar de qual imigra√ß√£o estamos falando √© um passo fundamental para a compreens√£o do Brasil.#racismo #racismoestrutural #migrantes #racism #migrants #direitoshumanos #humanrights #power

From my 365 consecutive days of meeting strangers. Day 216 - "It's Ok to be bored every once and a while."SEE THE FULL STORYhttps://lnkd.in/gfznHZeAFor some people‚Ä¶ being bored is a sin, but if you look at it as a space where you can shut down stimulus so your mind can work‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs really a place where you can come up with fresh ideas. Boredom is not pleasant. There are external things to combat it. Or you can simply let your mind wander. If you accept it, it can become a garden where you can grow new ideas.‚ÄùAt first, I am a little confused by my Kyiv-born friend of the day, Dmitry.In a considerate and heavily accented Russian voice, Dmitry is calm and calculated in his words as he sets the stage for our curbside discussion in a fashionable Beverly Hills shopping and dining district.A wonderful anomaly to the general tone of the public that is usual to the 90210 destinations; Dmitry's appearance strikes me to reach out to him. And as he reads as he walks on a street where so many are caught up in browsing store window to store window, it is quite curious as to who this Jimmy Hendrix-looking man is‚Äì and a Russian law student, studying at the prestigious Pepperdine University of Law, was farthest from my mind.‚ÄúI came to the United States thirty-three years ago, back when the Soviet Union was still Communist. My family was allowed to leave during the 2nd wave of the great Jewish migration. We were helped by the State of Israel and other organizations in the United States. 250 thousand were allowed to leave. Eventually, all of my family was allowed to leave, I was ten years old. It was a very interesting experience. A week in Vienna. A couple of months in Rome being processed, and then to a Chicago family who sponsored us. A year after that we came to Los Angeles.‚ÄùI have to ask, ‚ÄúWas the persecution apparent?‚Äù ...CONTINUED#sidewalkghosts #yourimpactmatters #richardradstone #change #affirmations #mindsetmatters #love#spiritualawakening #selfawareness #wellbeing #wisdom #positivity #yourself #mentalhealthawareness #selfworth #racism

"The Invasion"The UK's Home Secretary Suella Braverman thinks another invasion is underway. With reference to refugees seeking asylum in the UK she recently told the House of Commons that the country was being subjected to an ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù. As well as harbouring fantasies about ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù she used her speech at the Tory Party conference to stir up hostility: ‚ÄúI would love to be having a front page of The Telegraph with a plane taking off to Rwanda. That‚Äôs my dream, that‚Äôs my dream, it‚Äôs my obsession,‚Äù Braverman said. She added that she would like to see the flight before Christmas. Braverman then used her ¬≠conference speech to promise a blanket ban on anyone who enters Britain ‚Äúirregularly‚Äù ‚Äì ¬≠including on small boats across the Channel. #TheArtOfResistance #refugeeswelcome #videoart #artistsoninstagram #filmart #toriesout #racism #toryracism #torybritain #gtto #artistfilm

There is a lot of misinformation about pretext stops and this results in poor policy decisions being made. I agree with LAPD's new policy that requires officers to articulate the reason for a pretext stop on their body cameras before the stop is made. However, the policy goes further by restricting an officer's ability to make an investigatory pretext stop beyond what the law requires. This will reduce the effectiveness of proactive policing and will result in fewer warrant arrests and more guns and drugs on the streets.In Whren v. United States, the United States Supreme Court held that a traffic stop is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment if a police officer has probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred, even if the stop is a pretext for the investigation of a more serious offense. A pretext stop looks no different than a regular traffic stop. The only difference is the motivation of the officer making the stop.¬†Pretext stops should not be used as a fishing expedition to conduct random searches and warrant checks in the hope of finding unlawful behavior. A valid pretext stop involves a situation where an officer suspects that the driver was involved in a crime but does not have reasonable suspicion that would justify a stop. The officer waits for the driver to commit a minor infraction and then pulls the driver over for the infraction but with the intent of investigating the suspected crime.Officers should be required to articulate the basis for the pretext stop in order to avoid abuses of this practice. However, the LAPD policy goes further and appears to limit the ability of officers to make pretext stops for minor traffic violations. According to LAPD‚Äôs director of constitutional policing and policy, officers who observe something that technically violates a traffic law or a city code, but doesn‚Äôt put anyone at risk, are expected to not make a traffic stop. This restrictive policy would eliminate most lawful pretext stops which explains why the number of these stops declined so dramatically after the policy was implemented.#police #lawenforcement #losangeles #lapd #traffic #trafficsafety #policing #policeofficers #policeofficer #datascience #datadriven #constitution #supremecourt #policedepartment #racialequity #racialjustice #racialbias #racism #publicsafety #crime #crimeprevention #policemisconduct #policeaccountability #policereform

Your 101 Reasons to Hate is not a license to killDevastating news about the shootings at #coloradospringsHow do we stop this surge in hate crimes around the world?In a recent blog, I wrote:‚ÄúThe sharp rise in hate crimes is deeply worrying and highlights that not enough is being done by the Government to firstly explore why these crimes are happening and secondly to educate people, at scale, about why these feelings exist in the first place. ‚Äú (M‚Äôgadzah, 2022).‚ÄúPart of the problem is that we are failing to see the signs and symptoms of this hate and the dangers before it becomes full blown and extreme. We are also failing to find ways of tackling these behaviours partly because we have difficulty in talking about them and in describing them.‚Äù (M‚Äôgadzah, 2022)https://lnkd.in/eFcB2efM#hatecrime #Discriminations #SixStagesFramework #Misogyny #Racism #Violence #Shootings #101ReasonsToHate #ColoradoSprings #LGBTQIA

https://lnkd.in/eZaXYaDY The boss will be out in days but will the landlord do anything to change the racist culture? Was that culture developed as a way to reconcile the poor treatment of tenants and the failure to have habitable properties?Unless the unfit properties are made safe and habitable, the removal of the hapless CEO achieves nothing. #culture  #change #racism #publicrelations #socialhousing

GREENBOOK | üìó Academy Award¬Æ nominee Viggo Mortensen and Academy Award¬Æ winner Mahershala Ali star in Participant Media and DreamWorks Pictures‚Äô Green Book.

It is well known that racists and organisations tainted by institutional racism use silence as a weapon to weaken anti-racism.The sullen silence from - LSBU, its Vice Chancellor, Prof David Phoenix OBE and chair of Board of governors, Mr Jerry Cope, regarding the serious problems of racism impacting on students on staff revealed in the research in this THES article - is now at 1,158 days & counting.This post is part of my struggle for racial justice against London South Bank University. I hope it will encourage other survirour/victims of racism at the UK university to speak out in public. LSBU silence is a cynical ploy to silence us:#Justice4Edemahttps://lnkd.in/eTKHRjiX#education #research #london #racism #racialdiscrimination #silence #institutionalracism #whitesupremacy
