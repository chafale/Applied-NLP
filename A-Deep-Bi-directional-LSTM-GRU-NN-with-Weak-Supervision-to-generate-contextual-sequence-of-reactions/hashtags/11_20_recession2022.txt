Throughout the last 5 years, we have learned so much, survived so much! We all suffered. Regardless of your GPS coordinates or your race & color, people did climb up and then slide down while supporting one another through these crises. They supported their mates, their friends, their extended families financially & emotionally...Due to pandemics, foolish politicians and wars, the global economic recession, low-quality risk management plans (expand at all costs), dreams of driving Teslas on Mars, and the belief that people would continue ordering online and would continue their crazy consumption during the lockdown on petabytes of streaming/apps, plenty of technology companies big & small closed their doors and laid off their employees.Once again, you have seen technology leaders and professionals screaming out for them, offering assistance in any way possible, while showing true empathy & real offerings to help.I believe these experiences we have been through & survived thus far have given us an opportunity to tap into our reserves of mercy and compassion. Reaching out to each other, helping each other, understanding the deep human bond we missed. The freedom that we took for granted, the depth & weight of being connected to your family, friends & mates. We grew up fast and remembered the old lesson about not taking opportunities, luck, and life for granted. So finally, I urge myself & everyone reading this so far to stay positive, optimistic, and strong. We'll help each other pass this one more hurdle, we'll push each other to learn & move on again, simply because we are all one.KD#layoffs #pandemic #recession2022

#Layoffs #recession2022 #upskillyourself #emergencyfund As everyone of us has been hearing Layoff Season is going on currently. Giant MNCs have been firing lot of employees in name of fake documentation & Moon Lighting , But in real it is case of Cost Cutting and removing non talented People. Majorly Employees have been impacted by layoffs who have -- Debt amount of Loan Amounts to be paid for Car , House or any other expense. - EMI have been increasing since past few months to fight inflation - Regular expense of an employee considering householding Expense , Education Expense of children , Caretaker expense of Family How would they cope up with the loss ?This might be worst nightmare come reality for these employees. My Point of View :- Instead of Firing employees and making them jobless for months and months , Why cannot corporate sector stop increments of highly paid employees and reduce cost by decreasing existing salaries of employees who are in list of lay offs. This will help in WIN WIN situation , In this way Neither Employees will lose their jobs nor company will lose their talented Employees. On addition of it , Employees will continue to contribute in regular expenses without any fear or panic. If employees are under skilled or doesn't match skill set of requirement by project , Make those employees enroll in Skill Development Courses which can help them upskilling and save their jobs. On top of it , Emergency Funds should be taken care , which is utmost important part of managing your income and expense in worst case scenario. Maintaining Talented employees is as important as creating an Employment in Bulk  , instead of firing Employees. Everyone talks about Loyalty of Employee , No one asks Loyalty of Employer.

Zomato Today i was crying the moment I heard that you fired 540 employees from gurugram Headquarters not because of recession, but using the advance technologies so that it will reduce your employee cost. Come one Zomato why don't you think before taking them onboard, did employees don't have to feed their family, do they don't have responsibilities or you guys are playing with their emotions.Such harsh decisions will not help you to grow in future. #thinkpositive #recession2022 #layoffsandjobreductions

Hello allI saw an article in Building Magazine this week on recession dos and don'ts, that was a decent headline piece, but I thought I could help with a bit more detail from a work-winning perspective. I held a webinar at the start of the Pandemic on a 100-day plan that had many parallels and so I have revisted that 100-day plan concept for you in this video for what we face now in the next quarter, in any sector here in the UK. Hope you find it useful. https://lnkd.in/eeY79Yyg#video #recession2022

Oil prices fall more than $3 - Oil Supply Fears Recede - all it took was 2 days! - Not only a few days ago market was clamoring with fears of a supply crunch. Now those fears are gone! Did something fundamental happened? No. - There was a build up of bearish news. Recessionary signals getting strong. I always maintained that chances of oil prices going down outweigh that of going up. Comments by James Bullard and a recent survey by Reuters point towards the Fed interest rate rising cycle at 6 percent - also higher for longer. - Regarding oil supply: There are many projects being planned in the oil and gas sector that will ensure the needs and demand of future are met. This can be highlighted by a recent report in The Guardian  that speaks about the “frightening” growth in fossil fuels that can put efforts to curb carbon emissions under pressure. According to the report, the oil and gas sector has been piuring $160 billion since 2020 in exploration while 96 percent of E&P (exploration and production) firms have planned expansions. LNG expansion, for instance, is set to double in future.- Reference to my posts:1) Recently at Asharq News الشرق-https://lnkd.in/dJETmCWy2) Article in OilPrice.com- https://lnkd.in/ecxPYGHT3) Monday Macro View on YouTube for Primary Vision Network - Frac Spread Count - https://lnkd.in/dJCkBPqRI write in detail about this in my Substack below.#oilprices #oilsupply #demand #recession2022 #opechttps://lnkd.in/dZtHmT39

"RECESSION" is an opportunity to learn new stuff !!!#happylearning #recession2022 #developers #opportunity
-----------------------------
So, we're in a #recession ! Like many people I've been researching how to prepare for the downturn. What's clear is that recessions bring risks of making mistakes as well as unique opportunities to take advantage. Research from Bain & Co looking at performance over past recessions shows there are 89% more 'sinking ships' during downturns than stable periods, yet also 47% more 'rising stars'. What's also clear is that companies making adequate provisions upfront are more likely to be in the latter group.Here's a summary of what I've gleaned:1. Realistically assess where you are - know where you stand before entering this period vis-a-vis your competitors' strategic positions and financial strengths2. Identify and plan for different scenarios - develop signposts and triggers to monitor emerging scenarios with ready-to-follow actions in place when those triggers occur3. Establish cash management best practices - a recession usually brings lower sales and therefore less cash to fund operations, deft financial management is key4. Streamline your product offering - look to migrate customers to more profitable products and try to mitigate any potential supply risks5. Seek operational improvements and resiliency - address today's needs whilst looking to build flexibility and agility for the future, i.e. review your martech stack to see what's unused or isn't showing results6. Look beyond layoffs - some may be inevitable but according to a HBR study of 5K companies across the last 3 recessions, those that emerged strongest focused on operational improvements and other methods for reducing labour costs i.e hour reductions, furloughs, and performance-related pay; layoffs hurt morale, dampen productivity, and are expensive when you later have to re-hire and train7. Invest in tech - a) more ability to analyse what's going on and how the recession is affecting the business so you can react, b) tech can make you more agile and responsive to handle the uncertainty and rapid changes during a recession, c) lower opportunity costs as there are fewer pressures to divert resources towards manufacture given lower demand8. Refine your demand generation - reducing in-market buyers means relying on bottom-of-funnel lead generation will be limiting whereas demand generation identifies prospects much earlier and then educates and nurtures them to convert9. Build customer relationships - focus on retaining existing customers by doing the things that your competitors aren't to add value, create trust and gain business10. Decentralise decision making - foster the ability to gather information from across the business, especially employees "at the coal face", and empower them to make decisions and act quicker to affect change where it matters most, interfacing with customers11. Run more experiments - recessions equal uncertainty so running experiments allows you to discover what works and what doesn't in the prevailing conditions#recession2022 #marketing

Big tech companies such as Twitter, Meta and Amazon laid off 1,000s of their employees in the first sign of trouble in economy. Will the hype of securing a job in such big tech companies reduce in the future?Here's a quick poll to understand that!#layoffs #twitterlayoffs #metalayoffs #amazonlayoffs #recession2022 #recession2023
-----------------------------
SALESFORCE vs RECESSION CAUSES OF RECESSIONThere is n number of Economics pundits who are telling why it came. The major reason you all know is the Russia-Ukraine war.But then why IT sector hampered.?In the US & Europe, inflation is high which affected businesses taking loans at the higher interest rate. India is dependent on these countries' companies'.In cloud services, Indian companies' infra & skilled workers are lessLot of companies closed their operation in Russia.Increased rates of oil and gases on which western countries are dependent.Increased rate of edible oil, and wheat.Trillion-dollar stimulus is already given by all countries during the pandemic which is mainly affecting this period. Due to this cash reserve is less in all countries and the increase in inflation limits all countries to print new money.The 2008 recession was a soft landing recession but as we already had consumed stimulus so 2022 recession will have a hard landing.MID-RECESSIONWe are in midst of a recession. As per the economist, it will be of 1.5 years. Already 6-8 months we have witnessed and some more to go.JOB OPPORTUNITIESIt's obvious the number of calls as compared to the last couple of quarters is getting less as IT companies are focussing on cost cutting but without IT services/products it's difficult to run a business.Calls can be fewer as positions are reduced but for skilled people, it's not a recession.LAYOFFSThe most hit sector in a recession is Edtech companies. The layoff was for most non-technical people.In IT Developers are the people who have skills. They are the people who keep going operation smoothly. So there would be a demand for developers but it would be less due to the economic crisis.So you must be observing interview calls are fewer but the number of interview rounds is more and tough. But if you have skills then there are companies that are offering incentives to developers and offer letters with increment plans for the next 2 financial years.GOLDEN PERIOD FOR FRESHERSIn such a critical phase where all companies are cutting costs. But they can't stop operation. When product/service demands are less it is the best time when entrepreneurs can recruit resources at a cheap cost and can train freshers in the meantime so that when projects will come they will have trained developers. It will fulfill the purpose of IT companies at a low cost without affecting operations.TO DO LIST FOR FRESHERS and "TO BE DEVELOPERS"It's good to prepare for your exam from the start of the year rather than preparing 1 day before the exam. You got time to prepare and skill yourself.Learn Java, LWC, and Apex. Calls may be fewer but still, on the fresher level too, companies expect skilled freshers with the above skills.*SUMMARY*1. Make use of your social connections2. Learn new skills3. Search for a job in a recession-free advancing sector like Salesforce 😉#saleforce #recession2022 #freshersjobs #layoff

Once more we will be observing a V-shape GDP growth for the economies which is similar to the pandemic and a nostalgia about the things happened back then, but now we moved over it and now it is about to hit us again. All these forecasts bring our morale down but that’s how life is ups and downs will be there, then why to worry about them. GS report looks precise as FED’s appling all it forces to control the inflation. The glass is half filled with water. So why is everyone looking at the empty glass rather than focusing on half filled glass, Because at the End of Day it’s the way you look at it. I am seeing this as an opportunity to invest. I know there will be rough times but we made it so far, we can make it further. #recession2022 #opportunity #growth #staypositive

I noticed that when I plug in the hashtag #recession2022 Most of the posts are from...People from outside the United States. In particular from the UAE and IndiaSocial Media allows people to exploit an idea. To blow it out of proportion.To make it seem more real than it might beTo misinterpret it perhaps... this is merely been inflation, market corrections, some layoffs and mouting fear, followed by more layoffs, some of ya'll have never been a responsible parent/person in the belly of a recession. So you are feelin it more now. More aware..Exacerbated by Linkedin post junkies from overseas who want to write about it and perpetuate the fear Here's another thought:  "why does it take a recession or talks of to get people to start thinking outside the box?"PAUSE.

I'd rather start a business during a recession and fail, than start one in an economic boom and succeed, only to fail 5 years later. If you're able to provide a positive ROI to your customer, you're ALWAYS relevant.

By September 2023, the US economy is probably going to be in a recession with a 23.07% likelihood!The recent layoffs carried out by Twitter's CEO serve as a reminder that economic slowdown is a common problem.It results in: -Slow manufacturing; -Fewer sales; -More cautious investment;Laying off employees is one way businesses try to reduce costs. Now, it's challenging to produce excellent results without a great team.However, a path remains.By using "staff augmentation," you can achieve the same results for ~50% of the costYou can get qualified professionals for required projects through staff augmentation.Keep as much of the advantages as possible with : Fewer legal complications -Less expense -The quicker hiring processP.S., how do you plan to make your company recession-proof?#recessionproof #recession2022 #growth #layoffs #staffaugmentation

📱 Out of the corner of my eye - the BBC app headline runs across my phone - "UK is already in recession" . . . Is it? I'll be the first to put my hand up and say I fell asleep during economics; I have dyscalculia and my ability to take in accurately and assess facts about figures is not my leading skill 😏 I don't need to be able to analyse balance sheets to share these thoughts about all the recession scaremongering and I'd welcome your views . . .If purchasing a new product or service solves a problem for an organisation that in turn saves them money, or increases productivity making them more efficient and so increases revenue, profit margin or both - as a supplier of problem solving solutions, my gut says this is actually a good time to be prospecting and there will be organisations looking for savvy solutions 🤓 Tightening the belt, sticking your fingers in your ears and singing "la la la" loudly until this tricky financial time passes - may not be the best decision? 😵 Just my thoughts, and btw don't listen to me - I can't add up! #recession2022 #productivity #managedservices #dyscalculia

The present situation of inflation, recession, rising interest rates and job losses reminds me of "HELICOPTER MONEY'. This is the term used to describe a lot of money pumped into the economy to get it going during a slump. Most governments around the world pumped a lot of money into their economies in the last 2 years because of the pandemic and now this is resulting in a combination of inflation, rising interest rates and recession. Here's an interesting article on this:#economy #money #interestrates #recession2022 #inflation2022 https://lnkd.in/gKnfWxVn

Are we headed towards another recession? Some say yes and are experiencing the impact; others haven’t noticed, experiencing little or no impact.Regardless if you care to categorize it as a “mild recession (1.8 million job loss)” or “severe recession (3-4 million job loss)” or one at all; It is clear we have seen drastic changes in the economy. Companies with more debt and declining revenue can be forced into cutting jobs in order to cut costs, which is why we see increased lay-offs and unemployment. Some of the companies that made big cuts so far are Meta (11,000 cuts), Amazon (10,000 cuts), Phillips (4,000 cuts), Ford (2,000 cuts), Tesla (200 cuts), FedEx closed 90 of its Office stores and are taking other actions due to the revenue decline, and Walmart (1700 cuts including Corporate positions). Also, consumer and core prices are up from last year and are continuing to climb.#recession2022

Economic Rollercoaster is a thrilling ride without consent. So, how?The past few weeks, months, and even years have been disappointing and less than perfect for humanity. During such times, when covid-19 is spreading, exchanges are falling, asset values are fluctuating, prices are rising, layoffs are happening, some countries are fighting forever, countries are restrictive and you're getting pressure from various directions to live a better life, or even maintain your lifestyle - it is possible that you don't necessarily feel good all the time. Some of us might even get depressed or not be able to handle such situations better without help. So, this is my attempt to share with fellow community members a few approaches and attitudes that have helped me come out stronger from personal and professional turmoil. Below is a 12-step summary of what you can do? to go through this economic rollercoaster ride. However, feel free to read more details in the article itself. 1. Lower your expectations in general, but don't stop dreaming2. Stay away from the news and focus on building yourself. (If possible)3. Ask for personal, professional, and financial help as needed4. Support each other with empathy at home, work, and in society.5. Embrace the positivity in the world6. Keep working on your skills & self (mental & physical)7. Evaluate the sources of finance8. Do your best every day, every moment as much as you can9. Cut down on totally unnecessary expenses & re-invest in yourself.10. Eat & Stay healthy. Insure yourself & family against unforeseen circumstances11. Choose carefully. Explore the power of choice.12. If needed, don't panic to reset yourself, and your trajectory. Hope to listen to your views and comments. Do share feedback and feel free to reach out to me if you need any help.#economicoutlook #recession2022 #recession #mentalhealth #helpingpeople #empathy #tips #strongertogether #singapore

A new kind of global recession !Both The IMF and The World Bank are warning that we are edging towards a global recession, but a more concerning image is that - "This time the economic downturn is of a new kind" To understand better how the coming economic downturn will be unlike the one faced in 2008, its worth revisiting the conditions that drove it - it all started with a housing bubble in the US , a whole industry that ballooned across people giving mortgages and debt packages collapsed and pushed the banking system to the edge of collapse ultimately the crisis spread beyond the US , taking in EU thus in-turn triggering a global recession.How's the current economic downturn different ? This time money isn't the issue ! This time world isn't short of cash but its short of almost everything else - 1)Supply Chain CrisisWhen Pandemic struck ,factories from Asia to Europe halted production sending the global supply chain in free-fall, shortages of one thing has lead to shortages of another (ex- shortages of chip lead to car manufacturers delay production)2)War in EuropeUnlike during the US-led financial crisis earlier , this time Europe bears the burden , adding to that is the war in Ukraine, due to this war a new Energy Crisis unfolds in Europe, also what adds upto the crisis is that Ukraine was one of the worlds leading Agro-supplier , thus mounting up pressure on the agro-resources.3)The world is facing an inflation crisisThe US , The Uk and The EU are specially feeling the price surge (in the EU inflation is the highest it has ever been, in the US it is at a 40-year high!)4)China's Zero covid policyThe worlds economic powerhouse is facing a turbulent wind the pandemic policy and real-estate crisis have triggered slowdown a nation which for decades haven't seen a slowdown (even the 2008 recession couldn't effect China much and it weathered well during that time).Conclusion - What the expert describe this crisis is the one which is not set-up by banks but actually set-off by War, Policy making and Politics, it is clear now that the coming economic downturn is one of its kind and unlike from any other that we've seen in decades. Let's get ready to face the storm world ! :) P.S : To end this post on a positive note - one thing worth noting down is while major economies of the world are facing the storm , Few countries are bucking the trend. (just like China outperformed growth even during the 2008 crisis), for the first time since 1990's  The regions that are predicted to outperform this time are ASEAN , India and Indonesia. #people #growth #recession #globalrecession #jobseekers #ene #energy #supplychain #worldorder #linkedinnews #recession2022 #getready #turbulence #banking #inflation #crisismanagement #money

'No longer sure bets.'From Seattle to Silicon Valley to Austin, a grim new reality is setting in across the tech landscape: a heady, decades-long era of rapid sales gains, boundless jobs growth and ever-soaring stock prices is coming to an end.What’s emerging in its place is an age of diminished expectations marked by job cuts and hiring slowdowns, slashed growth projections and shelved expansion plans.The malaise is damaging employee morale, affecting the industry’s ability to attract talent, and has wide-ranging implications for US economic growth and innovation.With growth now slowing, the Seattle-based company plans to cut about 10,000 jobs, Bloomberg reported earlier this week, the deepest such retrenchment since the dot-com bust more than 20 years ago. #job #growth #tech #talent #recession #recession2022 #layoffs #employeeexperience #employeeretention

Some #economists argue that it is, while others maintain that recession is still a long way off. Who knows. Either way, it pays to be prepared.Plenty of warning signs show how you can get ahead of any impending economic downturn before it affects you and your business. One of those signs is liquidity—or the amount of cash available to meet immediate and future obligations.You're doing well if you have cash reserves that cover three months of expenses. But if you only have one month's worth of cash, you should look closely at your #expenses, line items, and #cash flow to see where to tighten things up before things go south.I'd love to hear what you think in the comments.#business #future #recession #recession2022 #money #cashflow

The eurozone is set to plunge into a recession over the next few months and economists warn it “will not be superficial”.Indeed, the region has been under significant pressure since the start of the war in Ukraine. The combination of sanctions against the Kremlin, the abrupt halt in Russian gas imports and the need to provide financial support to households and businesses struggling with the energy crisis have clouded the prospects for the Union, which was expected to beginning of the year growing faster than that of the United States.  Data from the European Commission showed that consumer confidence hit a record high in September. It has improved slightly since then, but households still fear for the future and their financial situation. #energy #recession2022 #investement

Our founding partner - Eugene Zhang and general partner - Spencer Greene commented on MarketWatch today on the “R” word: reset, not just recession, which is a common utterance among the VCs today.The question of the day is: Will #VCs continue to fund startups even when other investments haven’t yet paid off because of a slowing market for initial public offerings and acquisitions? Like Spencer said in the interview: “TSVC  is just as active as we have been, and we believe the people who are being laid off, some of them are going to be the next great entrepreneurs and we're always there for them".Reach out if you're building something keep excites you even in a soft market!!#layoffs #recession2022 #recession2023 #venturecapital #startupfunding #founders #entrepreneurs

During this #recession2022, most of us are UNABLE to give to the #causes we care about because the MONEY 💵 is tight. You gotta take care of you before you can take care of someone else😀. Unfortunately that’s that’s how it is. Anywho, since you can’t give like you used to, I am asking that you pick someone you know and PRAY for them. Ask God to do for them WHATEVER comes to your mind (listen to your inner man). In  doing so, you are #payingitforward ⏭️, GREATLY!!! It’s not always about money. Sometimes just remembering someone in prayer is all they need. Please make sure your prayers are GENUINE, too.🙏🏾. That’s the msg for today. If you are in AGREEANCE 👍🏾, SHOUT 🗣️ #amen 🙏🏾 In the comments.#gothw #a24 #saturdaythoughts #prayerworks #prayforeachother

The grave news of lay-offs of more than 100,000 people globally.   Data researchers at SkyQuest Technology collated data on global lay-off by sector. With technology startups doing the highest layoffs followed by eCommerce, The future outlook for 2023 is grim. The pandemic boom that boosted tech companies and their valuations has turned into a bust this year in the face of decades-high inflation and rapidly rising interest rates in the United States market.As the funding winter intensifies, below are the startups that have issued pink slips in 2022.We are at the business end of the year 2022, which has hardly been a smooth ride for the Global startup ecosystem. Startup funding is significantly lower than in the watershed year that was 2021 and a funding winter is here, brought about by several macroeconomic factors.After the public equity markets fell earlier this year, pressured by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, governments around the world deployed anti-recession measures. These measures involved increasing the interest rates, making debt expensive and draining both public and private equity markets of liquidity.The technology industry would take some time to recover from these  shocks.  #technology #data #ecommerce #layoffs #people #recession2022

I’ll be honest.I’m pretty immune to rejection.Overccoming obstacles is almost fun at this point. #jobhunting makes me want to curl up into the fetal position.I’ve been in #sales for almost 10 years.I never got upset or offended when someone hung up on me after a #coldcall , said no to a #demo , or to a sale.I’m completely unphased by public speaking, making calls, meetings with executives.But #jobsearch2022 is stressing me out because it feels personal.On the bright side:I had 10 interviews this week, and have more set up for next. 💃🏻Update coming soon about how I changed my strategy for #findingajob and the results.🔆🔆🔆🔆🔆🔆🔆🔆🔆Hang in there, everyone! 🔆🔆🔆🔆🔆🔆🔆🔆🔆#recessionproof #recession2022 #techsales #saassales #saasjobs #interviewprep #resumeadvice #jobsearch

Recession Ready? Mini Virtual Conference for AssistantsTuesday 13th December From 10.30am This is a mini conference for assistants, who want to be prepared for the forthcoming recession and what that might mean for your career.This event is open to any assistant - whether you are based in the UK or not.  You also do not need to be a member of EPAA either!Recordings will also be made available for 6 months after the event date - so even if you can't dip into the live version, keep it as part of your toolkit. You never know when you might need it! We know recession is looming and firms are planning cutbacks, if they haven't started already.  This isn't only affecting the UK, but many economies around the world after the global pandemic. Assistants who went through the 2008 global financial recession are already considerably resilient at dealing with economic downturns and understand what this means for some roles.  This day is simply to help, support and provide practical advice for those who want to ensure they remain ahead of the game, and also robust during these economically difficult times. I never rested on my laurels as an EA.  I knew it didn't matter how many awards I had won, or how much I had achieved - bottom line is bottom line. It is not personal, but business is what was said to me. It stood me in good stead and made sure I was prepared for any potential situation coming my way. Some of the sessions include: * Dealing with Redundancy Workshop * The only way is up assistant panel - Kallie Halai FEPAA, AInstAM Josh Dublin MEPAA Practitioner* Recruitment Q & A with the incredible Kam Vara* The one stop shop on adding real ROI during economic turbulence Anel MartinBooking link is here - https://lnkd.in/e8gcPD73#business #career #event #executiveassistant #executivesupport #executiveassistants #personalassistant #personalassistants #businessadministration #businesssupport #virtualassistant #virtualassistants #chiefofstaff #administrativeassistants #administrativeprofessional #administrativeprofessionals #professionaldevelopment #professionalspeaker #conference #recession #recession2022 #redundancy #redundant #redundancies #layoffs #layoff #costoflivingcrisis #costofliving #costoflivingsupport #virtualevent #virtualevents #career #careeradvice #recruitment #planning #help #ukeconomy #ukbusiness

Well worth a read for investors looking for perspective! “While the economy has yet to go through the worst of its pain, within markets it has felt like we are getting closer to the depths of the cycle … last week saw a promising signal coming from the US economy, which has driven investor excitement … markets rallied strongly. Bond yields fell as interest rate expectations immediately moderated”#markets #economy #recession2022 #autumnstatement #inflation #interestrates #bondmarket #bondyields #equitymarkets Armstrong Watson Future Money

“We must do everything we can to advance the cause.” Musk’s personal goal to save the planet may be admirable, but what he’s implying here is not.  In fact, these 10 words are a perfect example of what is known as the “dark side” of emotional intelligence. We gen­erally think of emotional intelligence as a positive quality, one that can help you manage conﬂict or establish deeper relationships. But in my book EQ Applied, I describe how people can also use their knowledge and understanding of emotions to motivate or even manipulate others with the sole intent of strategically achieving a goal.Once that goal is reached, or when individuals are no longer helpful to pursuit of the goal, they are discarded with little or no concern for their well-being.But on the 'Brightside' you did get PAYED....  #people #emotionalintelligence #workculture #whoprofitswhat #marketing #sheepstothegallows #2022trends #tech #future #recession2022 #christmasgifts

With the recession expected to last 24 months, and more than 100k+ layoffs and growing work has to change. Companies and leaders need to increasingly think in terms of project-based rather than role-based.Butts in seats don’t scale. We’re living in a project-based economy, and this shift toward the future of work is only accelerating. The more you can think of work as project-based versus role-based, the more agile your team and organization will be and the better chance you have to thrive.  #work #team #project #leaders #economy #futureofwork #agile #recession2022

In my many years of working with different teams on a wide range of brands, I’ve come to learn that people often have a narrow understanding of what a brand is. And by people, I’m referring to the very important C-suite. While some just *get it*, others need a nudge in the right direction.In brief:It’s not just a logo, a tagline, a product, or any physical asset.  Notably, it’s not something that can easily be measured—this may be why it’s one of the first areas to see a cut on investment, especially during a recession.But guess what happens if you cut on brand investment: you give up your space in the marketplace, making it easy for another brand to step in in your stead. Cutting on brand investment is akin to hushing your brand voice—you’ll slowly fade away from the conversation.Not convinced?Think of three brands. Now, think of how many other competing brands there are that you didn’t think of right away.And think of how many more brands there are that you don’t even know of. It takes work to remain unforgettable. There’s a reason a company’s most valuable asset is their brand, and that reason becomes clear once you understand what impacts a brand and how to measure it.So, before making any cuts, think beyond recession and you’ll realise: it no longer becomes a question of whether you can afford to keep investing in your brand but rather if you can you afford not to.  #brand #marketingcommunications #consumerbehaviour #branding #brandstrategist #creativeminds #businessstrategy #recession2022

We continue to see CPI’s rent data lagging behind real-time rents – and not just for new leases. But since new leases are the early indicator, let’s start there: Note from this first chart that while market-rate apartment rent and CPI rent trends (YoY) are converging, they are both moving rapidly in OPPOSITE directions due to a well-established lag effect – an issue the Fed is, of course, aware of.

There is no denying that eCommerce and retail have undergone significant changes in recent years. When the 2020 epidemic struck, consumer behavior shifted dramatically.People began to work from their homes. They shunned eating establishments, pubs, cinemas, and gyms. Consumers shifted from in-store to internet buying. They select lunch delivery and curbside pickup. Without a doubt, eCommerce enabled many individuals to survive the outbreak.And many eCommerce firms saw this as a chance to expand. While other physical retailers who did not prioritize their online presence have to adapt their business models and strategies in order to compete.But now we want to speak about a probable recession that everyone is talking about and how it would affect online retail.In this post, we will explain what today’s recession truly means, how it might influence your eCommerce business, and how to come out on top.#ecommerce #ecommercetips #ecommercemarketing #recession #recession2022 #agentpromovator

(Click the link to read the full article)Are we headed toward another housing market crash? - Short and sweet (though it may be a bitter pill).“Well, that depends.”  (At this point, this should be our slogan!)The concerns with the housing market in 2022 are different from what we saw just prior to 2008. While we also had seen a frenzy of homebuying then, we experienced a crash largely due to the significant number of people that had been approved for home loans who were not really in a position to afford the loan products they had been approved under. Loan practices then were not as strict as the lending standards that have been in practice since then. For the most part, homebuyers in the last decade plus have been financially stable, well-employed, qualified home buyers purchasing with conventional loans under conservative terms. Given their financial stability, as well as the stable terms of their loans, the fluctuations in the housing market, and even in their home’s market value, are not going to have an effect on their mortgage payment or their ability to continue paying it.#housing #homebuyers #mortgage #people #inflation #interestrates #realtor #realestate #housingmarketupdates #recession #recession2022 #housingmarketcrash #marketcrash #footerealestatedmv #yourneighboryouragent #dedicatedtokeepingyouinformed

Purchase Caps for Fannie and Freddie Loans Lowered for Next Year With Fewer Apartment Sales ExpectedThe federal housing agency overseeing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the federally backed home mortgage companies created by the U.S. Congress) cut the volume of multifamily loans the government lenders can buy next year by $3 billion each in anticipation of fewer apartment loans. This cap, however, is still higher than that of 2020.The agency has also created a new category for workforce housing to encourage loans on properties that have rent or income restrictions that are affordable to meet market needs. The goal is to provide affordable housing for people to live closer to their jobs, schools and hospitals.#multifamily #mortgage #housing #realestate #fanniemae #freddiemac #recession2022 #interestrates #mortgagelending #apartmentinvesting #affordablehousing Read more from CoStar News:

Here are 7 businesses which thrived during the recession.Source:https://lnkd.in/eFnYXZz#recession #recessionproof #recession2022 #tipsforbusinessowners #tipsforsuccess #Hubspot #mydirecteur #succesfulbusiness #thrivingbusiness #recessiontips #SupportSmallBusiness #supportbusinesses #supportbusinessowners #financeandeconomy

RECESSION? BRING IT ON!

There's so much talk about it because it truly impacts us all. Does the street where your business stands look like our post? Trust us, we are feeling the effects of the softened retail market as well. Empty streets, empty shelves, and empty shops. But guess what? Recessions don't last forever and while things may seem grim in the short term, we will bounce back stronger than ever if we hang in there. Don't push for record profits right now or you'll be disappointed and quit. Hell, in some cases don't expect a profit. Maybe a break-even is more realistic.

Whatever you decide to do, just don't quit building your business or seeking greatness. This too will pass and those of us who don't fold our hands before it's over will have a market hungry for what we are producing. And we will have a diminished competition after all of the others quit when times got tough.

So power through! We'll come out stronger on the other side of this together!
