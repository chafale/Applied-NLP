No no, let’s make something very clear.Ya’ll contacted me and *I* rejected YOU. *I* chose not to move forward with you. Because you are a multi billion $ company that offered me compensation 30% below the market rate and expected 100% in-person attendance. Gross. K? K. Also, that was like a month ago. Get it together. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a fan of ATS auto-messaging, but remember who your audience is and be mindful of which email they should be receiving.#ATS #AutoMessage #Rejection

Did you experience #victimization? Know your #value. This post is an excellent example representing that 'seeds sown in the right environment bears quality fruits'. Some seeds are sown in cement/concrete and the seed doesn't sprout/provide fruits. Does that mean that the quality of the seed is low or whether the environment did not provide the right #nurturing?Similarly, when we are qualified enough and still victimized at our #professional or #personal environment, its not that we lack the #skills but the environment is not right for us. We might apply for many #jobs that results in #rejection but it doesn't mean we are an #failure. Its simply means-we are yet to find the right environment. Even if it takes #time and even if i face #financial #challenges, i would rather be in a nurturing environment than being in a #toxic environment.  The opposite to success is not failure but quitting-Never quit. #neverquit #consistency #mentorship #india

What does a coffee ☕️ date with my Army 🇺🇸 Vet mailman 📬 have to do with sales? More than I thought. He came inside to drop off the mail. You can’t come into Starbucks and not get something,So bought him a hot coffee. We shmoozed for a bit and I got to learn a lot about him, About his family, children, And that he served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Respect 🫡.

It can be hurtful, disappointing and frustrating when we experience rejection. It is easy to take the rejection personally. Over four years ago, I was trying to find a new job. I had been applying and looking for three years, wanting to get into Project Management. Thank God I had a job while making the career change. I did everything I could think of: network, job shadow and join associations. I applied for four jobs and no luck. I was extremely frustrated and discouraged. When I met with my Mentor, he advised "rejection is for your protection." After three years, I did find a Project Lead position which was a great fit. As I face present rejection, I always think of that advice, and it gives me hope. Rejection is never an easy experience but by reframing it, we can keep hope alive and be persistent until the right opportunity comes along.How do you reframe rejection and disappointing events you face?#reframe #rejection #opportunities

There’s no crying i̶n̶ ̶b̶a̶s̶e̶b̶a̶l̶l̶ in PE recruitment…(10 points to the person who gets that movie reference)Anyone who has gone through a private equity recruitment process knows that it can be a roller coaster of emotions - anything from exhilarating, grueling, nerve-wracking, highly enjoyable, and sometimes monumentally disappointing.This week, one of my candidates was not able to bring home an offer h̶e̶ we had so highly hoped for.So what do you do when you know the classic “it’s not you, it’s me” line is actually untrue and you know for a fact that “it is indeed me”?I recommend a Rejection Reset.After you’re done m̶o̶p̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶s̶e̶l̶f̶-̶p̶i̶t̶y̶ ̶w̶i̶t̶h̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶h̶e̶a̶l̶t̶h̶y̶ ̶s̶e̶r̶v̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶r̶o̶c̶k̶y̶ ̶r̶o̶a̶d̶ processing emotions, over analyzing what you did or didn't' do / say, and hopefully receiving some insightful feedback, it’s time to reset:✅ Start thinking of setbacks as life’s little prickly attempts to test our foundations. Things built on weak foundations may very well crack under the pressure of these tests. Those that are strong will endure and strengthen. Rejection is PROGRESSION, not REGRESSION. Let that sink in.✅ Stay constructive and extract at least 2 learning nuggets from the experience that can help you improve or help you prepare for the next opportunity. Think of it as closing the blind spots.✅ Focus on building your tribe - that is, the network of professionals with whom you can refer to for guidance, advice, candid conversations, or simply helpful steers in the right direction.So if you’re going through private equity interviews, remember this quote, "It's supposed to be hard. If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. The hard ... is what makes it great." (20 points to whoever can name the movie and character)...#privateequity #lowermiddlemarket #middlemarket #rejection

I called my prospect to let ‘em know I’m closing out their lead. I wasn’t expecting it to go the direction it did. For a little background, They’d shown interest but have yet to take action after 7 months and 16 touches. (Not a great investment) So once I was anyways move’n on, I might as well tell ‘em. Nothing to loose anyways. Sent a close out email, And simply called a minute later to say “moving on folks!”I guess they saw that I didn’t need them,And am actually an opportunity. Will they likely get to it? I’ll still believe it when I see it. #sales #coldcalling #rejection #salespeople

Thought for Friday: RejectionsI was recently watching Girls Trip and the final monologue sensationally delivered by Ryan Pierce (Regina Hall) spoke volumes... "no one has the power to shatter your dreams unless you give it to them". This led me to think about rejections and resultantly this post. LinkedIn... who else does NOT aspire to work somewhere when they have been rejected at interview stage?I get it if you don't get to interview stage, keep on pushing, but I see far too many posts on here about people re-interviewing year after year after year. Let's keep it real. If someone at interview does not see my worth and value, and they reject me - they have lost me. When I was navigating the Training Contract process, I wanted to find a firm who valued me at final interview. It's a two way process. As much as I wanted to be a part of the interviewer's firm, I wanted them to want me... for me... my authentic self.I am grateful everyday for my two interviewers at Clyde & Co who saw me for me, what I have done, what I could do, and appreciated everything that encompasses and authentically makes 'George' as a person. However, I had equally endured years of the exact opposite prior to last Winter 2021.My overall reflection when I was navigating interview rejections was ultimately... why would I aspire and want to work for someone who does not want me and recognise my worth?I have been rejected over 50 times alone in pursuing a legal career, but all it takes is for that one interview, as Ryan's friend did for her in Girls Trip, to remind you of your own worth. My honest and humble advice would be, keep reapplying until you get to interview stage - but if you are then rejected - find a new opportunity. There are plenty of London, Regional, Nationwide and International Firms that can help remind you of your own worth.What are your thoughts LinkedIn?#legal #work #opportunity #interview #rejection

This post might seem negative for some people..and its not their fault.. it is just because they have not yet faced such a situation.. but it is correct.. initially, when i was getting rejected, i used to think that the problem is in me, but after 3-4 years i again went to that company(i will not mention their name) i met the same person, and just randomly asked why was i got rejected previously. she said that they had selected me, but after 2 days they received an email to hire a relative of one of the top management person. if this incident did not happen to me, my whole life i would believe that i was a failure..and obviously now my confidence is to the next level.. and i dont need to prove myself to anyone, we all have our own journey, and pace..#job #interview #selected #rejected #rejection #confidence #believeinyourself

I’m screening a list.Checking it twice.Gonna find out who’s not a fit, and who’s right.Canned responses coming. To town. 🧑🏻‍🎄Friday, I gave a #candidate personalized #feedback (email) on why we decided not to move forward with them.They had only spoken with me for a prescreen, no further stages. But I did really enjoy the time we had together. And felt I owed them more than a #canned #rejection email. At 4:47 PM on Friday they called me to rebut.The exchange of communication following the rejection email…has cumulatively consumed 3x as much time as the original pre-screen.It’s Q4 and we only have 4.5-5 good weeks left in the year for #recruiting.I’m not giving customized rejection feedback the remainder of the year (exception to candidates that have seen 3 interview rounds). It bites me in the ass 75% of the time. And only changes the outcome of the rejection .001% of the time.I will see if I re-evaluate this policy in the New Year.

I'm extremely nervous to share this (and not in a good way.) It's application season, meaning I've been doing a plethora of reasoning tests. The graphic below shows feedback from three different companies- all from the logical reasoning assessment. I wasn't on the top of my game this morning, and I've underperformed. This first bit of feedback is from a company that I was so ecstatic about applying to- now I'm expecting an automated #rejection email. However, I just wanted to show all other students out there that we all have good and bad days, good and bad assessments. I'm trying to not let his one result bring me down. Don't let one bad day erase the good ones. All I can do is keep trucking, keep trying and get back up. #failureispartofsuccess

It's a kick in the gut when you think you will at least make it to an interview with the recruiter for a position you applied for when your qualifications match a majority of the requirements for the position.  Didn't even get a computer-generated rejection email.  I had to go to my profile on the company's career page to see I was not selected.  Rejection is part of the process.

I got rejected many times. 😰I also got hired in the wrong job. ❎I can tell the experience from the second one is worse. Because you stay in that experience for a longer period.It takes you only a few days or weeks to get over from rejection. But it takes months or years to stay in the wrong job. 🧨Some people even don't get enough courage to quit the wrong job and get stuck for a long time. So, if you've just got another rejection, perhaps you're just saved from a bad job. 💯DM me if you need help to get a job and PR to live here indefinitely. 📥#rejection #jobs #jobseekers

💔To be rejected by someone doesn't mean you should also reject yourself or that you should think of yourself as a lesser person.💔It doesn't mean that nobody will ever love you anymore.💔Remember that only ONE person has rejected you at the moment, and it only hurt so much because to you, that person's opinion symbolised the opinion of the whole world.💔Rejection hurts, even worse when you don't know why.

Off we go again … 🥳I’ve just submitted my 2023 university applications and it feels pretty monumental.After missing out on my top choice university this summer, I was devastated. Up until that point I had a very clear vision of what I expected the next 3 years of my life to look like, but they were completely upended. I was left feeling lost, and with this sense of fear that I was going to miss out & somehow be behind everyone. The thought of doing the university application process over again felt far too overwhelming to even comprehend.Yet, here we are! And I’ve ended up applying for a completely different course (for the better, don’t worry).After a whirlwind 3 years of education during a global pandemic - being pushed into taking a gap year may just be one of the best things to happen. Instead of following the path of natural progression into a degree, I’ve focused on applying subjects I love. I’ve reestbalished my natural passion for learning and I’m far more excited by the prospect of university than I was this time last year. Even though at the point of being rejected it felt like the vision I had for the future crumbled around me, and nothing better could ever come of it, I am glad it happened. Thank you all for the support both on results day & since to get me back to this point. I can’t wait to (hopefully) share some good news with you soon …  #education #thankyou #learning #university #future #growing #rejection #redirection #gapyear #application #ucas

Today, I had technical round with Goldman Sachs.I had cleared OA and CoderPad round before this round...... but I was not able to clear the technical interviews.Even though that was not the outcome I desired, I sure did learn quite a lot during the entire interview process.Below are the key takeaways:- Make sure you go through the Job Description before your interviews. (I know, this is underrated, but this is important)- Make sure you know your resumé in-and-out.- Have a very good grasp on any one Programming Language.- Understand when to apply which Data Structures and Algorithms.....BONUS TIP: Rejections are part of life. We need to accept it and push harder next time!Keep Hustling 💪🏼Did you have any interviews recently?

If you lose a deal, it's okay to be angry.  Better said, it's okay to feel so pissed off that you want to scream, rip something up, or throw something across the room. Whatever the emotion - feel it, embrace it, and let it coarse through you body. For 5 minutes. 5 minutes to feel the rawness of the anger, sadness, and rejection. But when that 5 minutes is up - straighten up your shirt, clear your head, sit down, and figure out what your next move is. Why? If we suppress our emotions, they end up lashing out in unhealthy ways. But if we acknowledge them, they have the opportunity to be powerful catalyzers in our transformation and growth. #deals #sales #transformation #opportunity #rejection #alluviance

Had an extremely wholesome moment yesterday. My previous manager reached out to me and asked me if I would be interested in a sales manager position!! Although I’ve always hoped to progress from the bottom upwards and was thankful, I rejected his offer. I currently work for PurpleBricks and although I enjoyed the motor trade, (more the laughs and practical jokes with the other sales guys than anything else) I really enjoy working where I am, I feel extremely valued by my Area Director and our lovely team we have, have welcomed me with the widest of open arms! I know there will be a lot of people that are reading this knowing PurpleBricks’ financial situation with a redundancy scheme, which is being rolled out to most and eventually probably all of the property industry, would scream at me for rejecting his offer, but after many years in my sales career I’m no longer chasing the salary figure - which a lot of us in sales tend to do. I’m CHOOSING my happiness and putting that above all else! I’ve always wanted to become an estate agent as soon as I found out I can be my normal, hyperactive, crazy self in sales, so why would I turn my story back now, after I’ve finally made it! I work for a company that I truly feel valued and happy in! I don’t feel stressed, micro-managed or pressured! Which we all know usually goes hand in hand with sales! It was the easiest yet proudest no I’ve ever said in my life, but by god did it swell my head🫣😂 #team #work #sales #career #happiness #happinessatwork #happinessisachoice #rejection #offers #value

Are you afraid of rejection? ❌️I am a big fan of "if you don't ask, you don't get".This attitude has helped me excel throughout my career.For those of you who don't know me very well, I can be quite direct...🎯 If I need something from you, I ask.🎯 If I want to know how it works, I ask.🎯 If I don't understand something, I ask.HOWEVERAsking for something, comes with the possibility of rejection 👎That possibility seems to scare the hell out of people.Possibility does not equal certainty❗️In fact, in my personal experience, if you ask, the answer is more often yes ✅️ than no ❎️👉 People want to help.👉 People want to feel important.👉 People want to share knowledge.If you don't ask, the answer is always no.So ask yourself this: did you stop asking because you fear a no? 🤔#rejection #questionsworthasking #mindset

REJECTED (again)!Today I received a rejection from a job to which I applied in April 2021. That’s a year and a half ago. Do you know how long ago that was?  We hadn’t yet heard of the Delta variant. Pres Biden was about to announce the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Derek Chauvin was on trial for the murder of George Floyd. Abortion was still legal in all 50 US states. My self-assured 8 year old son was a 6 year old finding his way.My dad was still alive.

Rejection can feel like a knife to the heart.   Yeliz Akin ✨ shared an awesome post earlier about this very topic and it inspired me to jump on the bandwagon.  I know #rejection is a common theme, but it's important to talk about. Especially when many out there are dealing with it right now.  I was told 'No' So.Many.Times. when I was looking for jobs.  Did it hurt? Heck yes.  Did I give up? Sometimes...But only temporarily.  Then I got back to it.  This topic is fresh on my mind because my son received a "Thanks but no thanks" email this morning. It hurts.  It's disappointing.  We talked through it before he jumped on the bus.  And we'll talk through it again when he gets back home.  I don't think hearing "Thanks, but no thanks" gets any easier, but we can always decide how we respond to it.  We can also decide to learn whatever we can from the experience…Then we move on with hope and fortitude for better things to come... Because there are better things awaiting.  What have you learned from rejection?#motivation #inspiration #keepgoing #dontgiveup #believe #success #life #storytelling

Rejection is not fun.I've found that rejection becomes positive when we respond by:1. Pivoting to something else (note that this is different from quitting)2. Trying againTwo examples from my college years illustrate these two optionsExample 1: Pivoting to something newFor a time, I thought I might want to become a Seminary Teacher.  I took the required classes and taught a couple of seminary classes at a nearby high school. I worked hard and did the best I could.I was not selected.Given I was already pursuing a career in tech I decided not to try again. No regrets.Example 2: Trying AgainThe first time I applied to the BYU information systems program I was rejected. I had worked hard, but my grades weren't up to par.Rather than pursue my backup option (computer science), I decided to double down on Information Systems and try again.I retook several classes, aced them, and then took every available class that would help me stand out as an applicant and/or help me graduate early after getting into the program.I got in the following year and graduated a semester sooner than the rest of my peers in the program.I'm so glad I tried again!--I am grateful for both of these experiences!Rejection may cause us to feel powerless, but when we focus on HOW we will respond (either by pivoting or trying again) we can retake control of our lives.#mindset #rejection

Walking out of fear 😨 No it’s not easy at all. As human beings we are mainly governed with two fears::1️⃣ Fear of failure 😞 2️⃣ Fear of rejection 😏Both of them actually restricts us from taking several actions and our decision making is severely affected. When you are in your workspace, you have to walk over both of these especially. At work, you need to take risks, fail fast and fail differently. We only learn when we fail. So if you keep having fear of failure, you cannot grow. Acceptance of being rejected is tough, but at work space, this is never end of story. You need to get up and ring the next bell, quickly with much energy if you are rejected from first point. Be it is your job or your #business, anything that will matter in your growth path will be, your #courage capacity and #courageousleadership What is your take on fears at work!  #work #growth #energy #failure #rejection #mindsetiseverything #leadershipmatters #job #corporate #leadershiplessons

"Every time I thought I was being rejected from something good, I was actually being re-directed to something better.” ~Steve MaraboliIf you get rejected, acknowledge it to yourself. Don't try to brush off the hurt or pretend it's not painful. Instead of thinking "I shouldn't feel this way," think about how normal it is to feel like you do, given your situation.Rejection is normal, be it a relationship, a job interview, anything and anywhere!#rejection #redirection #emotionalintelligence #feelings #itsmearatigarg

Another day … … another rejection….… which leaves space for something even better to come along. The rejections sting but they don’t define me and they’re definitely not a reflection of my abilities, knowledge, or expertise. And your rejections aren’t a reflection of you either. I’m reminded of a story that I used to tell when I coached new entrepreneurs. I think I picked it up on a course I once did with T Harv Eker. Imagine a pair of fabulous handmade shoes. The stitching is exquisite, the leather is soft and supple, and the design is just divine. You love them …You want them … As you stare at them through the window you imagine how amazing you’ll feel when you get them on your feet. With a beaming grin you excitedly walk into the shop and ask to try them on. They’re the last pair in existence …Completely unique … They’re absolutely perfect …… except …As hard as you try, you just can’t get them on your feet. You squeeze your toes in, wincing at the pain, but you can’t for the life of you get the heel on too. After a few more tries you sigh deeply but have to accept that as wonderful as they are …… these aren’t the shoes for you.  They’re just not the right fit. But the fact that they don’t fit doesn’t detract from their exquisite beauty. They’re still as amazing as they ever were. As the shoes are placed back in the window you see another person light up at the sight of them. You see the joy on their face.You see how easily their foot slips in. You see how well the shoes suits them. And you know that this person and the shoes are a more perfect match. So when we get rejected we need to remember that we’re just like those shoes. Still unique Still accomplished Still fantastic And the perfect fit for the right opportunity when it comes a long. #resiliency #opentowork #rejection

Today, I got a rejection. I pushed myself out of my comfort zone, and pitched something, did something different than I probably ever would have done in the past. The thing is, it sort of feels great. Firstly, the rejection was passed over to me with such respect that I don't feel an ounce of shame. And second, if this is the rejection that I've been fearing, the thing that stops me from making bolder moves, going after bigger clients, or just pushing myself to the next level, I now realize how ridiculous that is. There's a sense of relief when you realize that the fear you have is actually much less than the reality. I share this for two reasons :1. The importance of giving over rejection respectfully can truly make all the difference in the world. Doesn't matter who they are. 2. The fears we have that stop us from doing so much in this world, are often so far-fetched that they are almost never realized. Hopefully, this gives you that push that you need today #rejection #fears #growth #hudsonfilms

Let's talk about: application #rejection and the impact it can have on job seeker's mental health. Throughout our lives, many of us have received those "Thank you for your interest in X," "Your application and qualifications are impressive, but we are not moving forward with your application," "We appreciate your time and effort, but we will be moving forward with other applicants at this time" rejection emails. Every single rejection email stings a little, but when you receive almost two to three per day, you start to feel even more hopeless and discouraged. With each rejection, your mind starts to question...am I good enough?  Will I actually find another job? What's wrong with me? I'm here to tell you that YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH. You have been good enough and you always will be good enough. Your job doesn't define who you are as a person. Your relationships, friendships, hobbies, interests, add up to make up who you are. The job hunt is hard. It's exhausting, but I know it won't last forever.  I've linked an article below that provides more insight into job search depression and helpful tips on how to manage your mindset while looking for your next job. ⭐ If you have any advice for current job-seekers going through the searching and interview process, please share them below in the comments! ⭐ #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthsupport #layoffs #jobsearching #jobapplications

Have no fear of failure for this to is a success.I have been #jobhunting for a little over a month now. The experience has been very mentally challenging for me and I’m here to share my story. When I received the news that I needed to search for another job, I felt defeated. Even more so when I would get rejected to tech positions, which I thought I was very qualified for. Constantly reading “Thank you for applying but unfortunately…”, oh the dreaded UNFORTUNATELY. I honestly believed that I was unfortunate, a #failure for not being able to get a #job. (For context: I’ve been working since I was 17 in the tech industry, so let’s just say that #rejection wasn’t something I was familiar with). Each morning the same routine, take my sister to school, come back and start sending resumes, do interviews, take coding assessments, eat, sleep and start again. By the third week of unemployment, I started applying to any nearby non-tech job. I finally received a “CONGRATULATIONS!” just not the position I thought. I was hired for a position at Target. Negativity just consumed my mind. My initial reaction was again of being a failure but my mom was quick to give me some much needed advice. Here is what she said:1. Never be embarrassed about having a job, be #proud of what you do2. #change will only hurt you if you don’t adapt to it3. Always keep your #goals in sight4. Open yourself to new possibilities and keep #learning 5. The future has great things in store, so enjoy the ride! 🎢Wise words for my mother and I guess I have one more advice to add. As a fellow #genz, I would like to invite anyone who feels like nothing is going their way or feels like a failure, to #trusttheprocess. You can only grow and learn from here. Have a fantastic turkey week everybody! 🦃  #experience #future #share #success

Let us have a look at something important-	# Do not just share your profile with anyone or everyone.	# Understand your profile first & then start looking for a job.	# If you have any dream company then go to their career page, LinkedIn Page & all other possible way to confirm about the suitable opportunity.	# Read the JD & make sure the requirements (Location/Qualification/experience) they are asking for are obvious on your profile	# Just applying online means you are dropping your profile to a vast database where may be 10,000 applications are already there.	# Applying in any job does not mean that you will get selected but with this you are sharing your personal data with others so be careful.	# Avoid a lot of complicated formatting in file.

So you have just got #declined after being interviewed for few rounds? How do you react to the #closing? Few tips on how to handle #unsuccessful_interviews:- Close it on a #goodnote - Keep the people whom you interviewed with as a #connection and part of your #network. - The #market is big, but yet believe it or not, it is also small with #people #connected to each other. Leave and close on a good note - Seek #feedback and provide #feedback where needed. While providing feedback, make sure you do it #eloquently and if needed. #GreatEmployers value feedback from candidates to improve on their #candidateexperience and processes, and you should take that as an opportunity to connect further with them and build further #rapport. - Never #badmouth an employer you interviewed with on social media platforms. Keep it #professional. -  Seek #lessonslearned from your own interviewing experience to help you with other future interviews. - Lastly, it is a #REDIRECTION and never a #REJECTION.#Rewire your #mindset.

Worth Sharing#EmotionalFirstAid Emotional First Aid by #GuyWinch and how loneliness and favouritism can affect your #health and long term #performance.Few key takeaways (for the people who are unbothered to check the YouTube video):We value the #body more often that we value the #mind , sad to say ... We favor the body over the mind. No one second guesses it. If a kid scratched his knee, he will automatically put bandaids on the cut so it doesn't become infected, but what will we do about a psychological wound? Will we tell the kid if he is not feeling good to "Oh! just brush it off". If it were a physical injury and the kid broke his leg...We won't say ... Oh! just walk with it again like nothing happened!! Why do we take care of brushing our teeths more than our mind? that's one example...We sustain failures like #rejection #loneliness etc... more often than physical ones... and even if there are psychological proven methods most people won't go for them because of social stigma and fear of being judged that they're imperfect. We are humans. We are #imperfect.Healthy mind 🧠 = Healthy body 🏋🏻‍♀️ = Healthy everything 👨‍⚕️🤝🔧⚗️🦺🛒💸📈and the opposite applies 🔄https://lnkd.in/gwKuZpvMللمشاركة #EmotionalFirstAid الإسعافات الأولية العاطفية بواسطة #GuyWinch وكيف يمكن للوحدة والمحسوبية أن تؤثر على #صحتك وعلى المدى الطويل #الأداء. بعض النقاط الرئيسية (للأشخاص الذين لا يكترثون للتحقق من فيديو YouTube): نحن نقدّر #الشخص في كثير من الأحيان على الصحة الجسدية أكثر من #النفسية ، ومن المحزن أن نقول .ذلك..  إذا خدش طفل ركبته ، فسوف يقوم تلقائيًا بوضع الباندا على الجرح حتى لا يصاب بالعدوى ، ولكن ماذا يفعل حيال الجرح النفسي؟  هل سنخبر الطفل إذا كان لا يشعر ب#ضيق النفس و #كربها أن "أوه! فقط قم بإزالته".  لو كانت إصابة جسدية وكسر الطفل ساقه ... لن نقول .. أوه! إمشي مرة أخرى عليها وكأن شيئا لم يكن !!  لماذا نعتني بغسل أسناننا أكثر من أذهاننا؟  هذا مثال واحد ... نحن نتحمل حالات الفشل مثل #الرفض # او #الوحدة إلخ ... في كثير من الأحيان أكثر من تلك الجسدية ... وحتى إذا كانت هناك طرق نفسية مثبتة ، فلن يلجأ إليها معظم الناس بسبب "العار" الاجتماعي والخوف من الأحكام المسبقة عليهم بأنهم غير كاملين.  نحن بشر  نحن لسنا #كمالين  العقل السليم 🧠 = الجسم السليم 🏋🏻‍♀️  والعكس صحيح https://lnkd.in/gwKuZpvM

Normally the issue isn't that you have no #control or don't know what to do. The issue is that for some reason, you just don't do it. Losing weight is easy conceptually, but difficult in practice because it requires overcoming emotions, sensations, etc. Getting clients in business is easy when you understand the statistics behind marketing activities, but is hard in practice because you must battle the fear of #rejection, #failure, #fatigue and #doubt, etc. If you ever enter a year and think, "This is going to be a tough year," it is ON YOU to change that. If you believe it will be hard, then it'll be hard. If you commit to doing what you need to do to get the result you aim to get and you stay true to it all year, you'll hit the target. There is still a month and a half to make up for your lacking areas this year so far. Don't waste it.

So yesterday, I interviewed an MBA Guy with 5 Years of Experience in Sales but still he got rejectedWhy? Because I learn from my mentor that you don't need to be good or bad. You just need to be a fair. When I was having a conversation with him, he was getting stuck again and again. He had low confidence. He was getting nervous. I truly want to hire a talent with such an excellent academic background and great experience and stabilityBut I can't afford my time and energy to get wasted again on a guy who is not confident in himself. Moral: Believe in yourself. Radiate your confidence. Academic success is last thing any company considered. #sales #event #rejection

Are you an international student? Have you been rejected?Don't let it get you down.You will get through it. You'll be fine.I hear you. I know it's hard to get into a job that you really want. You might not have the same kind of grades or test scores as someone who has cracked the job before. Your experience might be different from theirs, and you might feel like there's no room for you in this space—and that's totally okay.But don't take the rejection to your heart; it's just a stepping stone until you get where you need to go. It's not the end of the journey, because there are more opportunities out there than ever before.We are in this together!

Rejection, schmejection.Yesterday, our team was asked how we deal with rejection. I racked my brain trying to come up with an answer, and I realized...I don't. I stay so busy that when I hear a no, I just think "oh ok" and move on to the next task.Sure, it's better than wallowing - but it also means I don't really learn anything from rejection. As someone who loves to learn, that was a huge wake up call for me.It's time to start reflecting on the nos and turn that knowledge into more yeses.Who's with me??#rejection #learning #sales

Here's four great tips on how to deal with rejection! 👇#rejection #motivation
-----------------------------
I’ve been rejected by employers, people, situations and publishers.Today, I think of rejection as redirection. This changing in thinking has shifted the way I look at opportunity because once fear of rejection is removed, what have you got to lose?  Fear of being redirected in another, better direction?Any application or approach I make is to seek out the right path for myself or an initiative. I need neither approval, validation nor permission – Just an indication as to whether that route is right for me. And the answer is usually pretty obvious.#opportunity #rejection

“No.”“No.”“No, but thank you for applying.”Rejection is part of the job search.We always say that the right will come around. But we don’t talk about how each one can sting, just a little.They do sting! It comes with a sigh, and some disappointment, regardless of what others say.But I will say, I had the BEST rejection come this past week.Excuse me? Best rejection? YES!I applied for a position with this company a bit ago, and got the wonderful generic email. “Thanks, but no thanks.”Then, like less than 5 minutes later, HR called me and explained WHY and then asked what I wanted to do. She then proceeded to tell me to apply for this other position within the company.So I did. I sent her back a thank you email and told her I applied. Her response? “Great! I’ll get back with you after the weekend!”My motivation is restored and my confidence is built back with a simple phone call. Thank you CreatorIQ for having an OUTSTANDING HR!!!

This is especially challenging for me to post today.As someone who has struggled with #mentalhealth challenges, especially #anxietyanddepression, as well as #adhd, for all of my adult life, this feels a little like the pot calling the kettle black. In fact, I'll admit that yesterday, I was pretty out of it because I had messed something up and I wasn't quite over it. But as a #careercoach, I do know this is true -- when we embrace rejection -- rather than resisting it -- my clients find more opportunities, and I find a better life.#resilience #rejection #jobsearch #jobhunting #jobhuntingtips

So I tried going for the NO on this call 📞. I was surprised 😮 at the results. The “NO” from my basic understanding, Is putting on the table 🍽 That this isn’t of likely intertest to the other party, aka my prospect at the moment. I mention that it’s probably not on my callers to do list at the moment. It worked in a BIG way. Looks like we’re finally taking the next step together after 7 touches. Whether I’ll onboard them as a client remains to be seen.But the first part of the sale is complete….….Creating enough trust to have my prospect send over a merchant statement for analysis 🧐.#sales #coldcalling #rejection #salescalls

I was waitlisted for #pharmacy  school. Yes, this #PharmD, #residency  trained, #BCPS, #BCGP, and #mha earning self professed lover of pharmacy.It was hard at the time, but it was one of the best things that could have happened to me. As a first generation college student I was eligible for a summer program where I took Pharmaceutics, Physiology, Biochemistry and a skills course. I had to still work full time. So I took courses from 8-1 and worked until 11 pm for 8 weeks. The review of heart failure let me help a coworker. Sitting at the 4th of July BBQ I saw the one sided edema and started asking questions. I drove her to the hospital where they figured out she had her 2nd heart attack, probably the day before. Connie Valdez taught me that.I had to ration my time and having gotten a 100 in calculus I spent less time on pharmaceutics. I bombed the hell out of the first test thanks to plug and chug. Tom Anchordoquy expected me to whine. I didn’t, but I got every point on the final right. He also helped me eventually teach part of the program, Biochem.At the end of the program I learned I had the opportunity to be a #pharmacystudent and eventually a #pharmacist.#rejection  can be redirection. Have faith in you, because you have endless potential like an indeterminate metabolite.

Rejection and failureEveryone is scared of rejection and failure. But failure and rejection is the first stage of success. So, we have to face rejections. If we do not face rejection and failure then we will never be successful. We learn by our failure, we make mistakes and learn by mistakes. A spider can not climb on the wall at once but they never lose hope. They always try to climb on the wall and do hard work and make efforts and after some time they succeed. Every successful person has many failure stories like APJ Abdul Kalam, Rajanikamt, Sachin Tendulkar etc. We learn from our failures and next time we make more efforts and try to do our best. Sometimes it happens that we do our best but we fail and we lose hope and think like losers but we did not think that we learn, that is most important because "kuch na karne se kuch karna acha hai". Set your goals and try to fulfill by hard work practice and focus on your goal one day you will be successful.#successful #hard work #failure #rejectionNeelam Writer

rejection email : "after careful consideration", "while your background is impressive", "while it was difficult decision"How many times have you experienced that?😅I can no longer remember.I can not also stop applying for. In the Greek Army, where I served in Special Forces, we have a saying : "who dares wins" (ο τολμών νικά). That being said, he who dares to apply or be rejected, he wins. And don't forget. Being rejected is part of the process. You get to know what you actually want in some point, and more importantly, what you deserve. Keep applying, little star. The best yet to come. 💪#recruiting #webdev#vienna#europe#rejection#layoff

He is less interested in describing his failure and helplessness. But in case of me, I don't think it's bad to say something about our loss sometimes. Instead of silence and confusion, we accept the "existing situation" with all its bitterness and put an end point to the old ways and trying new methods should be tested as I don't interpret failure as a #weakness, but I consider it a part of the process of self-development and having this feeling can move me forward more firmly than before.Today, I received another 3 emails of #rejection. Cheers guys.But instead, my supervisor in my performance evaluation form noted that I am overqualified for the position that I am working.

So glad to see this publication on #impurity #rejection applying #computational methodology, resulted from a broad #collaboration across multiple companies and disciplines. Together we can tackle more challenges in new drug development!

Are you experiencing rejection?After sending that perfectly crafted CV, it's difficult to deal with rejection.We may believe that we are not good enough or that employers will not hire someone like us.Rejection can have an impact on both emotions and physical health.There are many reasons why your CV may not result in an interview.These include: 👇✅The CV was never read by the right person.✅The CV was too long and boring and therefore was not read.✅The CV was irrelevant to the reader’s needs.✅The CV has grammatical errors and spelling mistakes and therefore did not deserve a positive reply.✅The CV was difficult to follow because of the poor layout and the reader lost interest.✅Your CV arrived too late to be considered.✅The reader found your CV interesting but did not envisage any openings.✅Due to the volume of applicants, your CV was never read.If you read through the list carefully, there are reasons for rejection that we do not have control over.Acknowledge the pain and move on!If you know your talent, I guarantee some employers are looking for you.Till I come your way again, Stay high-Value.For more high-value content connect and follow Raymond Ayinde🍷#rejection

Those who did not hear back from #meta or #twitter recruiters either after applying to the jobs or after going through all rounds of interview……would be feeling like they dodged a bullet!Don’t focus on one company and don’t frown if you didn’t get selected in that company. Focus on the role, learning, growth and team. (Salary too 😛)P.S.: A year back, I was one of them. Lesson learnt- Not every rejection is bad. Things do happen for a reason and time is the biggest leveller. #interview  #recruiters #rejection #softwareengineer #interviewexperience #layoff

The best thing in life to do is not to regret and try to change what happened, but to interpret it properly, maximize and use it to serve other people. That's what I want to do with my past.✨ #job #rejection #keepgoing #ItsNotTheEnd

Your self-rejection blocks your authentic gifts and talents!At this point, it is common knowledge that your edge comes from your uniqueness.You will do well if you can play to your unique strengths; that can only happen if you're authentic.So why is this insight so challenging to implement?It is so challenging to implement because we are constantly rejecting ourselves. Of course, the degree can be different, but it is in all of us. We reject ourselves and try to be someone else because we feel like that will get us more acceptance, love and success.However, even when we get some version of those things, we feel empty inside because we doubt ourselves. We feel like a fraud.That is because it deepens the belief that we don't deserve those things as we are. Accepting ourselves fully is the only way to step out of this pattern. When we do this, we don't reject ourselves when others reject us. By doing this, we begin the healing process and start the journey towards becoming the best versions of ourselves.#success #selfdoubt #rejection #selfawareness

The art of HANDLING REJECTION is undoubtedly a much required skill in business, career, Life, you name it.Sadly, a lot of people find it very hard dealing with rejection in Relationships, business, Job search, Career and life in general. My first major #rejection came, back in 2020. I had completed a job interview for a role I was looking forward to, only to be told no.At the time, I thought it meant that I wasn’t the right fit for the job. “Maybe I don’t have a lot to offer” I thought.Well working in Marketing, you learn a lot about REJECTION. I get to face and experience it every single day. Truth is, that’s a completely normal part of life and that’s what I failed to understand back then. As a matter of fact, you should expect rejection...you gotta be ready to handle it without taking things personal. IT IS NOT, YOU.They’re probably not a right fit for you, your business or product/service. Don’t beat yourself about it...move on to the next prospect, and the next...until you get a response in the affirmative.My name is Richlove and I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK in your #job search, #business, #life journey and remember...rejection is a normal part of life.

There are as many real worlds as people - Carl RogersThere can be multiple ways to #perceive the same incident. We perceive a situation using our 5 senses and it is different for different people. For example - Not getting selected for a job interview could be perceived as '#rejection by some and they may think that they are '#incompetent'. For some it could be a feedback and a chance to improve.Everybody has their own realities according to their perception. And nobody is right or wrong.The learning is if we can change the way we view things, our whole reality could be changed. Changing perception cannot be forced upon someone. It is a process and it happens only in a safe and a #nonjudgmental space.#mentalhealthawareness #perception #positivepsychology #carlrogers #counselling

#Reflecting on how it's been a great year for me as regards #creativewriting  submissions!✍🏽✍🏽In Summer,I had two #poems published in The Wombwell Rainbow online and an 75 word limit #microfiction in Paragraph Planet online.🙌🏽On November 5th, I was delighted to have a #prose #poem  published in Tendon Journal, the literary journal of the Johns Hopkins Medicine Centre for Medical Humanities🙌🏽And  last week, my #flashfiction  modern day twist on the Red Riding Hood fairy tale  set in modern day London, was longlisted in Northern Gravy, a fab literary periodical based in the North of England.🙌🏽 please all keep your 🤞🏽for the shortlist decision!The learning for me?Don't be afraid of rejection, keep writing, revising work and keep submitting work elsewhere . Tenacity also helps!Both the flash fiction stories and microfiction were rejected once each by other journals/competitions-so what did I do?Put them away for a while, let my brain percolate, went back to them and tweaked a little where needed e.g. the microfiction went from 50, to 80 to 75 word target of Paragraph Planet), and looked for other places to submit that might be suitable for my work.Like all artforms and crafts, writing is subjective; what suits one editors taste or is suitable for one outlet doesn't fit for another.Yes,#rejection of any kind can feel hard at first (I know this well as a #medicaleducator #academic-what a transferable skill!),but it is all part of our #personaldevelopment. What's that saying, again?"If at first you don't succeed..."So to fellow #writers and #academics, whatever you are working on, keep writing,keep submitting and good luck !✍🏽🤗 🍀

I want to talk about fear of rejection. Are you with me? I've always have struggled with potential rejection. Not sure why but everytime I lose a potential contract I struggle with that rejection and I take it personally. When I say I take it personally I mean blaming myself for something I did wrong. Even more so, when I just can’t get the other side to at least reply either with feedback or by at least being honest and saying “ok, we went with someone cheaper, because we don’t want/can't afford to spend more” or something similar. When you don’t receive the outcome you’ve imagined it’s hard to accept that mentally. When I quote a project I don’t treat it as a number and maybe that’s where I’m doing something wrong because I try to treat them as a human being needing my help so I get too deep into the details. I do the same with all our projects, I treat each of our projects as if it was our own, caring for each detail, striving for perfection as it were.This is one of the negative traits of running a business and being your own boss. I believe founders don’t talk about it as often as they should. That might be down to fear, fear of not being seen as successful. Sometimes we just need that yes or no answer to have some closure.Now, for the positive part of this post I'd say the more you talk to people the more you can try to understand their position and we are all busy so taking it personally won't help the situation or yourself. Putting yourself in your prospect's shoes can also help soften the blow.I've been trying to see it from their perspective and for the last couple of weeks that fear of rejection has improved.I discovered you can't always be in fear specially when meeting new clients as people see through that.The secret is to maintain yourself neutral, no project is secured until they sign on the dotted lines and the money is in your account.What have you done to overcome fear of rejection in business?#MentalHealth #Entrepreneurship #Rejection

The upside of rejection leading to redirection is the common theme of a job applicant, a career changer, those looking for a promotion, an unexpected redundancy, and anyone stuck in a merry-go-round of having successive doors shut in your face.The glimpse of a door that gently opens into a brighter future is not far away.There is much to gain when you think all is lost.#future #optimism #redirection #rejection #fortitude #resilience

I'm pretty sure he woke up on the wrong side of the bed that day 🤣 I remember one time I was selling a Food Tech CRM product that offered a new experience for restaurants and their customers.In my opinion, it's a product that would work really well with bigger restaurant names, and I reached out to a long list of those DM's and tried to get as many meetings as possible. I was sending many emails, making many calls, there's bound to be an error somewhere here or there, we're all humans after all.I sent that one email out to this big restaurant's head of marketing, and it missed my eye that I left the greeting as "Dear {Insert Name},"Fastest response I ever got to an email, "since my name is not {Insert Name}, I assume this email reached me by accident and therefore will ignore it and never consider doing business with your company"What's the weirdest rejection reason you got?#rejection #storytime

When I decided to apply for a job at Chubb this year I remembered that I had applied before and that I was rejected without having had an interview.Recently I was searching in my mailbox and coincidently the Chubb rejection mail popped up. It was funny to see that it was a year ago (October 2021) that I had applied and now exactly a year later in October I actually started a job there 💼.Just a good reminder to everyone to see that it is worth it to re-apply after an initial rejection and that it can turn out great! No need to give up on the company 🍀#chubb #jobhunt #rejection #reapplying

😌 I feel the need to share a reminder: During the job search, not every rejection is personal.I've been rejected numerous times, but hearing "no" doesn't mean they reject you as a person; there are other things to consider.➡️ You may not get the job for many reasons, and it often deals with circumstances outside of your control.➡️ Keep doing your research, networking, and tailoring your resume. ✨You still have value and your time will come. ✨Check out these four reasons why you may not get the job! Are there any other reasons you can think of?------------Ring the 🔔 on my profile page to see more posts on career strategy and inspiration.#jobseekers #value #rejection

Two areas the enemy of this life likes to get us to accept and camp out in is #Rejection and/or #Fear.

I have learned #Fear is just an opportunity for #Courage. Perspective causes us to transition these normally icky feelings to one of gratitude and forward motion.www.brandyjflanagan.com

"Unfortunately, we will not be moving forward with your application, but we appreciate your time and interest in our company."This was part of an email I received about a month ago.And if you're no stranger to rejection mails, I'm sure you get what I mean…This was the first time I actively applied for a job as a digital marketing executive through LinkedIn…When I saw the message, I was beyond weak. I was discouraged.So, what did I do?⚠️ I allowed myself to be sad.⚠️ In my state of annoyance, I mistakenly dropped my phone.⚠️ I shattered my screen. ⚠️ I payed to fix my screen.⚠️ And….I was still sad.Nothing changed....things only got worse.Should you let a rejection mail get to you?NO!What should you do then?✅ After reading the mail, go to the company's LinkedIn profile.✅ Get their contact information✅ Send an Email to them saying that you recently applied for a job position, got rejected and would love to know where you went wrong..5 out of 10 companies would reply telling you what they were looking out for.1 out of 10 companies would end up giving you the job because of your "readiness to learn."So instead of getting sad every time you get a rejection mail, see it as an opportunity to get better.An opportunity to tweak that resume…an opportunity to get a better opportunity.Getting discouraged wouldn't do you any good. "There's always light at the end of the tunnel." But you'll never know until you enter the tunnel.Don't let the fear of rejection stop you from getting your miracle!How's your day going?😊( Ps : How do you deal with rejection emails?)#linkedingiants #dtgol #lcwf #ConsistencyTourWithJenniferOchada#20dayslinkedinchallengewithhaoma #120dayspreewithhusseinfaizat #tuesdaythoughts #rejection

I got a pretty heartbreaking "no" today. 💔 A client I had pitched rejected my application and went with someone else. And this was for VOLUNTEER work. 👐This equine-focused client had a red-hot 🔥 need that they were desperate to fill. As a 501(c)3 organization, they needed a copywriter to partner with them. I did. I was literally bouncing in my seat, "Pick me! Pick me!" as I virtually clicked my name into the hat. This morning I got the "We're sorry to inform you..." 😭 I didn't even get past the first line (like didn't even get to the closing period OF that sentence) before my feelings were crushed like a little tiny Miriam-shaped grape. Out of all the feelers I put out there as a volunteer, THIS one was what I was most excited for. ⭐ It fit my niche. ⭐  Was a killer project. ⭐  Would've been a great opportunity to expand my equine/livestock focused portfolio⭐  Low stakes for someone just finding her feet (me, yes me). While I'm still bummed, I'm trying to look on the flipside— 🐎 🌹 Must not have been fated. 🌹 Maybe they'd have been a bad client.🌹 Or, what if I'm overqualified for what they want? Tracking differently looks like—🛤️ "This mean I suck" WHILE REALLY "Maybe I'm overqualified."🛤️ "I'll never get clients in my niche" WHILE REALLY "It's not the right time." 🛤️ "Maybe I've got this whole thing wrong" WHILE REALLY "Growing pains means something B-I-G is coming.""No" ≠  value. One "no" may lead to a stupendous "YES" later down the line. Maybe this "no" from a 501(c)3 volunteer opportunity means a "YES" from one of my dream western brands. Dream bigger, and bigger dreams happen. ⭐ (In the meantime anyone know of some western brands looking for a copywriter that wants to fulfill this one for me? 😅) #copywriter #copywriting #freelancer #rejection

I want to talk about #weekends for a second.This is the first #weekend in two and a half months that I am truly enjoying. On the surface, it's not any different from the prior eleven. Even though we fell asleep at about 2 a.m. last night (same story every Friday - we try to keep ourselves to a midnight bedtime during the week, but owls that we are, once the weekend arrives, our schedule goes out the window), I still woke up at 8, but diligently forced myself back into bed until my ŌURA ring was satisfied with me hitting eight hours for the first time this week. A lazy breakfast was bookended by two halves of Newcastle United Football Club taking on Chelsea Football Club and followed by the Sprint race of the #F1 Brazilian Grand Prix. A call to Mum, a few household chores - and it was off to ALDI USA and Lunds & Byerlys to catch up on pantry staples we've run low on. Back home, Brienne insisted on fighting me for a string cheese stick (I really wish I had my phone out), but eventually settled down for what has now gone on as a four-hour nap (and counting). Cats. They really know how to while away a dreary (and it IS dreary - 30 degrees and 100% cloud cover) day.Tomorrow looks likely to be an encore, although Manchester United are playing Fulham Football Club and the feature F1 race is on at noon, so it actually might be a bit more entertaining. Not that it truly matters. For the first time since late August, I am not going to bed wishing Monday would come already. Don't get me wrong. This is in no way a comment on my new #job, which I am enjoying tremendously (by the way, if you ever need an awesome camera for a board room or a classroom, I'm your guy). But this is the way it's supposed to be. On Friday, after a long and hopefully productive working week, it's normal to be happy the weekend is here. It is a lot less normal to wish it'd pass quickly so that you could rejoin the #jobhunting rat race, to feel bad for enjoying life’s simple pleasures (like sitting on the sofa doing nothing) and to question whether or not time spent watching a football match should instead be dedicated to updating my #resume for the umpteenth time. But that's exactly the cycle I had found myself in. Very few #recruiters work on weekends (as well they shouldn't), so it would be at least 48 hours until the next #interview #offer or #rejection. It's a process that is very easy to get hooked on. And, boy, am I ever glad to be done with it.That said, I know that, thanks to a never-ending string of big-company #layoffs, a great many people in my professional network are only entering the initial phase of what I went through in late August. With that in mind, I cannot say this enough: if I can put you in touch with someone in my network, look over your resume or just lend a listening ear, please, please reach out. So many kind souls were there for me when I needed help - and now I am glad to finally once again have the means to be that resource for someone else.

15 years back I was desperate to get into IT industry. I was building new skills to transition. I started applying for new IT jobs. Finally I got an interview call from a large IT Co.I reached the venue, I saw hundreds of others sitting and waiting. We were given a sheet to solve coding problems.  Before that I had never done coding. I knew nothing from that assignment. I didn't clear the 1st hurdle itself.Few weeks later I receive an interview call from the same co. This time it was for a much senior role.I was sent an air ticket to travel to Mumbai from Delhi.The venue was a posh hotel in Mumbai. Business and HR Heads took a long interview of mine.I cleared the interview. Few weeks later I got the job offer for a senior role. I spent and grew in that company for 7 years.I realised rejections are opportunities in disguise.Next time you face rejection, start searching for the hidden opportunity. You will find them. Did your ever face a rejection that turned into an opportunity later?#Rejection #CX #SaaS #Tech #Sales P.S. Here I'm in front of an engineering model depicting inter-connections.

Rejection.   Not a feeling many deal with easily…Ever notice how being turned down stops some people from trying again, while others bounce back from rejection stronger than before? Everyone experiences the sting of rejection, but mentally strong people use that pain to grow stronger and become better.  Whether you were excluded from a social engagement, or you were passed up for a promotion, rejection hurts. The way you choose to respond to rejection, however, could determine the entire course of your future.Here are five ways mentally strong people overcome rejection:1. They Acknowledge Their Emotions2. They View Rejection as Evidence They're Pushing the Limits3. They Treat Themselves With Compassion4. They Refuse to Let Rejection Define Them5. They Learn From RejectionCredit: Inc.com To see more details under each of the 5 ways, read more on the article:https://lnkd.in/eDVXpymy#rejection #movingforward #motivation #elfdevelopment #professionaldevelopment #pushyourself

What is Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria?RSD can result from growing up with overly perfectionistic standards, experiencing rejection or abandonment at a very early age, being made to feel guilty or ashamed for normal behaviors, trauma, or abuse. Signs of possible RSD can include high sensitivity to the possibility of rejection, overly high standards for yourself, easily triggered toward guilt or shame, aggressive behavior to perceived slights of others, frequently feeling misunderstood, self esteem that is completely dependent on what others think, and intensely focusing on whether you said or did something wrong after an interaction. Working with a trusted counselor to challenge the accuracy of your dysfunctional thoughts, labeling them as invalid, and letting them pass works for many suffering with RSD. Cognitive behavioral therapy can also help teach better response mechanisms.  #trauma #divorce #abandonment #fatherlessdaughtersofdivorce #counseling #rejectionsensitivedysphoria #rejection #selfesteem #behavioralhealth

Why is it that the more experienced you are , the less opportunities you will have. Big names like Cvent American Express , they will be looking for experience in their own sphere, rather than giving you a chance to prove your worth. Inspite of having 9 years of experience still these companies don't hire people as they don't have customer service experience. Even after clearing 3/4 rounds you still won't land up with the job as you don't have the experience they need and require..Which I understand is not wrong but atleast give some one a chance to prove themselves. A person having 8-9 years of experience won't be that useless after all ..Another thing that really baffles me is the fact that these companies on paper boast about their work ethics laws rules regarding equality discrimination against gender race age etc. but everytime you try to be a part of such good companies the first question their HR's would ask is "what's your Age" Now can anyone please tell me what does my age has to do with my work efficiency, as long as I am healthy and can do my work why is that any problem. This is extremely hurtful for endless people who might be above 30. If you are being honest with these HR's regarding your age , your gaps etc they turn your down. If you lie then also eventually that's not something morally right. I am sorry but have experienced these things and still not able to understand why does the system so corrupt every where. All you need is a chance to grow & prove yourself but so many endless conditions questions come in your way. Why didn't you apply just after graduation, why was there a 5 years gap...Same old useless questions, my professional experience should be counted from the day I started working, and ever since that day if there isn't any gap then why should there be any problem.Everyone is just following everything blindly, we try we fail we learn. but what's the point when no one wants to see the talent inside you. So much struggle for nothing.Thank you#hiring #rejection #employeeexperience #jobs #failure #employment #hrcommunity

I don’t know who else needs to hear this.. but if you got rejected by a job opportunity you thought you really wanted.. knowing you’re qualified and in some cases overqualified! IT’S OKAY. Not only do you deserve to be with a company that will value you and recognize your hard work, experience, etc. but it’s also probably happening for a good reason! REJECTION IS REDIRECTION.Except it, breathe and move on. You are enough! You are brilliant! #rejection #jobopportunities #ontothenextone

I have a fear of rejection.This is something you normally get when job finding. Applicable when asking for promotion too. After all, we don't want our years of effort down the drain in a 1-hour interview. Big no.BUT, this can easily be mitigated if you plan well. Here's what I did to reduce my anxiety.1. Jotting Down2. Use the STAR Model3. Be Visible4. Know Your Strength5. Work With the Recruiter6. Don't Lie, Just Be Confident[𝟭] 𝗝𝗼𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗗𝗼𝘄𝗻Every time you accomplish something, jot it down. Don't do this last minute. Use tools like Evernote (which I did) to note your accomplishment. This is not only helpful in finding a new job, but to get promotions as well. Over the months, this list can get pretty big.Important: Take special note of the "impact number" for your accomplishment, for our next step #2.[𝟮] 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗧𝗔𝗥 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹[S]situation, [T]ask, [A]action, [R]esult. This model is used to get yourself compose and confident. Given a situation, what did you do and what's the outcome of it? Use this along with Step 1 above. There's a reason recruiters suggest this model every time.Now, use "impact number" when it comes to [R]esult, such as, "my action helped boost the sales by 120%."[𝟯] 𝗕𝗲 𝗩𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲You can use your communication channel, such as Slack. This is more important when it comes to asking promotion. It will be weird if you stay quiet for years, and suddenly are asking for a promotion. Leaders should be proactive.[𝟰] 𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗴𝘁𝗵You might get lowballed, which will impact your confidence. Know your own strength and weakness, you know yourself better than the 1-hour interviewer.[𝟱] 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗪𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿For job finders, communicate well with your recruiter. As I mentioned always, recruiters are your friend. They have a few tips up their sleeve, waiting for you to ask them.[𝟲] 𝗗𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗟𝗶𝗲, 𝗝𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗕𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁In your resume or interview, never lie. If you don't know about a framework, just say so. It's alright not to know everything. (Which is why, exclude unrelated experience or "5-stars over 5-star gauge 🌟" from your resume) There's a trick for this though. Be confident when saying NO or I DON'T KNOW. With smile. Say to them that you're willing to make up for it, or your plan to tackle that lack of knowledge in the nearest future.In summary, just be yourself. It can get tiring to be someone else over a lengthy 1-hour duration.That's all I can remember for these tips.— Let me know if this is helpful. Share in the comment how you overcome your fear of rejection!A photo I took while walking with my wife to the center during Fall season in Germany.#career #rejection #interview

Ok... I'm backtracking here...So, I know, I know... Last week I wrote a lovely post about the upsides of rejection and what we can learn from it. Very optimistic and philosophical 😜 But it's also super important to know that sometimes rejection just plain and simple sucks... and that's ok too. 😞 Feel what you have to feel with it.Cry about it.Write about it.Remind yourself of your strengths.Go for a walk/run/get some fresh air.Give yourself the evening off.Ask the recruitment team for feedback.Reflect on what you've learned.Then, move on.Keep going.There are more opportunities out there, and right now this one just isn't meant for you.(Writing this to share my thoughts, but also because I really need this today)#rejection #team #writing #recruitment #jobsearch #employability #disappointment #motivation #determination #opportunities

Sometimes rejection is just saying you are a better fit for something else.We need to rethink rejection.Even God Himself does not choose you for everything.He chooses you for the things you are called to.You were not rejected.You were called to greater. Now go be great! #rejectionA rejection is God's way of closing a door to nowhere and getting ready to open a door to take you to a place that is a perfect fit for you. #rejectedWhen people misunderstand and reject you, don't feel miserable.It's bound to happen sooner or later.It's part of God's plan to make you realize that you shouldn't rely on His creation but only on the One who created you.People will let you down, but He will lift you up! #rejectionquotesRejection is just God's way of saying wrong direction. #rejectionsAs I look back on my life, I realize that every time I thought I was being REJECTED from something good, I was actually being re-directed to something better. #rejectOften times, it is necessary in God's plan for men to reject you in order for God to raise you up as a cornerstone. #godsplansYou may want to hear this, God did you a favor by letting them reject you! #godsplannotmineSometimes, the things that break your heart end up fixing your vision. #godsplan🔥YouTube/podcast,👉🏾"Uplift Past Crossroads"👈🏾🔥Facebook/LinkedIn = Sean Christopher Jenkins🔥Follow👉🏾@troubledontlast 👈🏾IG/Twitter/Snap/TikTok🔥Turn on Post Notification - Like - Comment - Share - Save➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖..My other Instagram pages:Subscribe to YouTube(in bio)👉🏾@my_daily_bible👈🏾Podcast(in bio)👉🏾@upliftpastcrossroads👈🏾YouTube👉🏾@upliftwithdrj👈🏾Fashion👉🏾@glamourmeetsgq👈🏾..👤 Tag a friend ⬇️➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖#trustingodsplan #trustgodsplan #godatwork #godisworking #godisworkingonme #godsplansarebetter #godsplanisperfect #allthingsworktogether #allthingsworktogetherforgood #godsplanisbetterthanmine #godsplansarebetterthanmine #beingrejected #rejectionsucks #rejectionisgodsprotection #allthingsworktogetherformygood #godwillworkitout #godisworkingitout #godisworkingbehindthescenes #godusesallthingsforthegreatergood #notaccepted #rejectionisprotection #rejectionisredirection

I've been applying for jobs for several months now, which means I have received my fair share of rejection emails.I also applied for a grant recently and received a rejection that felt so much more humanizing than anything else I have received of late.They said, "Due to a high volume of competitive applications, we were unable to offer grants to many outstanding candidates."This is SO MUCH BETTER than most of the language in form rejections, which includes -"We've had a lot of interest in this position and candidates that are more aligned to our needs for the role, therefore we can not consider you for the role on this occasion."OR"At this time, we have decided to pursue other candidates who appear to match the skills, experience and our requirements more closely."All three rejections are sending basically the same message - "We had a high number of applicants who meet the requirements, and since we have limited resources, we had to come up with additional methods for screening out potential applicants."But the latter two focus on the methods used to screen out qualified applicants (choosing who most closely aligns/matches the role requirements), whereas the first focuses on the actual problem (a high number of qualified candidates seeking a pool of limited resources).The first rejection honors the fact that many of those who are rejected were highly qualified.The second rejection sends the implicit message that a rejected candidate was not good enough.HOW you reject someone matters.Focusing the rejection on the true problem (a high number of applicants) vs the proposed solution (justifying methods used to screen out qualified applicants) is so much more human.As dozens of rejections pile up, it takes a psychological toll.This is magnified for marginalized applicants who are also fighting inequitable and biased job search processes.The language we use matters.The creation of more equitable and human systems matters.The major issue with the current workforce is that there are a high number of qualified applicants competing for a small pool of open roles.The more honest organizations can be about that reality, it will make a huge impact on the well-being of job seekers.Be human first.#jobseekers #jobsearch #jobhunt #rejection #perspectivematters

Say YES even when you are not ready.After powering through my fair share of challenging situations and scary, riskier decisions, I’ve noticed a pattern.While it's much easier to sit back and not push myself, it’s also much more boring and unsatisfying than putting yourself out there, taking risks, and discovering the world and yourself.I’ve found that the things that scared me the most, have been the best things I could have done for myself. And I’m sure that if you start to do the same, you’ll notice it, too. The thing is, you may never feel ready, so why not just do it anyway.I promise you, you'll grow in ways you never thought possible, and your world might just expand a little further.What is the scary thing you have done and said yes to?.. #success #rejection #lifelessons #personaldevelopment

"Maybe you're just not good enough for the jobs you want?!" said a self-professed 'hiring guru' to me last week in response to my talking to another commenter about my history of being #rejected more than 900 times for #jobs I was both qualified for and capable of doing.And it got me thinking about, with tens of thousands more people looking for #work right now, thanks to the #techlayoffs, how many of them are going to be told the same thing, and how destructive it will be for some of them?Consider this - We bend over backward to convince people we're able to do the jobs that we #apply for, starting from when we're teenagers getting our first summer gigs.So imagine what it's like for someone who takes all the steps we universally agree should get us the jobs and #careers we want, only to be told the same thing each step of the way.✔️Achieved in #highschool - ❌ 'Not good enough' ✔️Went into debt to obtain necessary #degree(s) - ❌ 'Not good enough' ✔️Got #internships and/or low-paying #entrylevel gigs to 'pay your dues' - ❌ 'Not good enough' ✔️Developed additional skills relevant to the #careerpath you want - ❌ 'Not good enough' ✔️Networked with industry #professionals, sought #mentors and guidance to be more attractive to potential #employers - ❌ 'Not good enough' ✔️Painstakingly curated the #resume, #coverletter and #portfolio to get consideration for #interviews - ❌ 'Not good enough'Adam Karpiak talks a lot about not 'selling yourself short' when applying to jobs you want.The problem is that the longer you've spent in the brutal cycle of perpetual #rejection from employers, #recruiters, #hiringmangers, etc., the more it boosts your #selfdoubt and cripples your #selfworth.And a judgmental choad selling tips to 'hack the system' on #linkedin telling someone, "Maybe you're just not good enough?!" helps no one.Know what does #help? HELP.Rather than shooting someone's dreams down. Show them how they can lift themselves up and get to where they want to be.Your #ROI will be exponentially higher. I guarantee it.#dobetter #bebetter #pr #communicatons #tech #ta #talent #hr #jobseeker #opentowork #backtowork #hiring #contentmarketing #contentcreation #contentwriting #copywriting #agency #mediarelations #people #empathy #mentalhealth #therapy #rejection

- I was offered a Director role..to be based in Jakarta, IndonesiaEven before I could decide on itThey revoked the offer& REJECTED me after the offer- Before I joined AmexI was outrightly rejected in the interview- When I applied for a marriage leaveI asked for 30 days leaveIt was upfront rejectedThey approved only 9 daysWhat happened subsequent toall of the above?___________________________It was again during the second attempt, another international role happened & I relocated to KLIt was again during the second attempt I could crack the Amex interview and joined themIt was again during the second attempt, I could re-negotiate marriage leave for 26 daysYou won’t always get what you want in the first attempt itself. You will need to be persistent at it. You will need to find ways to make that happen. Giving up after a first NO will not lead to any growth. Dont easily accept NO for an answerFind ways to convert that to a YES :)Rejection is a part of the process EMBRACE IT, LEARN FROM IT, BETTER FROM IT#MyGrowthJourney#Rejection

Rejection isn’t very nice and it’s never made anyone feel super elated.It’s a fact that ethnic minorities and people from lower income households will face more rejections in their lifetime than their counter-parts. This is due to many factors such as, low quality education, systemic racism and the list goes on! But that’s a whole other post! Irrespective of the odds, luck and social/economical structures society has placed us in, there is a blessing in rejections. Although it might not seem like it. It quite possibly could work in our favour.  Or maybe I’m at the point of delusion. Who knows. How you may ask? Well, hear me out,  #opportunity Every time I’ve failed or been rejected it’s been an opportunity for me to be kinder, wiser, upskill and know my worth. But mostly inspires me to keep being the change the system needs by not conforming. I have no desire to be the “best” at what I do, it doesn’t mean I have any less ambition or work ethic then someone who does. But I have every desire to lead with love and create content that’s true to its purpose. I’m here to tell you that it doesn’t take for you to be a CEO, the “best” in your field or a workaholic disguised as a “proud perfectionist” to be successful. It’s truly subjective! So keep going and like me if you face rejections often, see it as your super power.Peace and blessing  Munna  #work #education #future #change #rejection #failure #socialmobility #society

#Fear. This is an emotion I have come to know on a daily basis. As an #entrepreneur I have faced and continue to face many fears. Nothing is guaranteed at all, and more people than just myself and my family rely on my #performance. If I can relate how I approach #business to any sport.. I think that #baseball would be as good a metaphor as any. I have a rule for myself when it comes to how I approach the game. Every swing is a home run swing. When I choose to pursue an opportunity (I see a pitch I like), I am not trying to hit a single, I'm trying to hit Eutaw Street or McCovey Cove!I miss a lot, though. I face #failure and #rejection all the time! It may seem like me and my team just win over and over again, but we lose a lot of games, and I go a lot of at-bats striking out. In May of this year I only did around $200 of new production. One of the worst months in my entire career. In baseball, just like in business, you only need 3 out of 10! We don't need to win 250 games (A workday is a "game" for me) a year, we need to win 150 or more. I don't need to hit the barrel of the bat on every opportunity, just on one or two out of every 8 or 10. I believe that a lot of business people, salespeople, and even athletes are so afraid of failing or of striking out, that they decide not to even #try. They approach the plate timid, afraid of the pitcher they're facing. Know this, if you step up to the plate confident that you are worthy and able to knock a ball out of the park and you focus 100% of your energy on each pitch, you WILL hit some bombs. The key is not letting the fear drown out your confidence in #YOU. Business and #LIFE is scary at times, but if you know you're in the right business and that you have the skillset to hit your goals as long as you show up and give 100%, you must make the deal with yourself that that is what you're going to do. Anything other than that guarantees you won't hit your #goals.

Rejections. Every rejection will make you a stronger candidate. This will make you more resilient in the process, more reflective and more self-improvement. Rejection reminds that you are getting to your goal, and you are achieving it. Rejection often motivates you get better and improve further. However this rejection differs from social rejection. You are not alone facing rejection.Rejection hurts but the reality is that many strong candidates experienced rejection.It is a time to understand you deeper self and find your values with it. How do we handle rejections? On a side note, I appreciate Claire Jutsum has put out this note which is very encouraging:The ultimate question is whether we are ready to apply for the law firms. Here are few questions that can be act as check list:1. Knowledge of the firm: Did I understand enough about the firm to express my motivation to apply? 2. Attending law firm events: Did I apply for and attend any of their virtual events? 3. Networking: Did I network with employees and really seek to understand the firm’s culture, aside from what is stated on their website?4. Work experience: Did I have enough work experience in order to answer some of the more complex application questions? 5. Academic excellence: Did I prioritise achieving strong university grades, over the time required to make a strong application?Other than the above, I will add to the following to the list:6. Competencies: Do you think you can demonstrate transferrable skills to match with the values of the firm?7. Confidence: How confident are you when writing application?8. Proof-reading: Have you asked your friends to proof-read the application? Have you written the application in a structural way?#motivation #rejection #lawfirmapplications #selfawareness

Many wonderful Neurodivergent women feel excluded and rejected by the world they live in causing them to "mask"Feeling rejected can make you feel "less than" and isolated. It can cause you to make yourself small.I don't believe in rejection. I believe what many of us have been taught to view as rejection is actually the Universe protecting us and redirecting us away from people or situations that aren't for our highest and best.If you'd love help shifting your mindset around rejection try this recorded energy healing and meditation session I created https://lnkd.in/gcu_DZvz#neurodivergent #neurodiversity #rejection

We must be clear on acceptance and rejection. We must be adequate at accepting and rejecting something or someone. Once you have accepted means you have to suffer the pros and cons of that acceptance. Before making any decision always think about that even with urgency and emergency. Sometimes we believe that we don't need to think in an emergency. No! we all have to speculate before diving into any pool(decision-making process). After acceptance, you have to withstand both good and bad because everything has two sides.  In urgency, we make quick decisions and regret them after some time. "I wish I would have not made it then". No! Wait and think before it. Whether it is for giving money, making a relationship, doing a job, getting married etc. But, rejection is best you have to suffer only once. Rejection is best but not every time. Think and make and accept all the pros and cons of Acceptance and Rejection. #job #money #acceptance #rejection

Rejection hurts, but it needs to be normalised. There are good reasons why: 1) the world is competitive; 2) you don’t always get what you want; and 3) rejection is inevitable.
Behind every post about a new job appointment; manuscript acceptance; or successful funding, are untold stories of many people who were rejected. Central to these stories are recovery and re-attempts. This post contains our stories (mine and my followers) - how we recovered; and tried again.  #mindset #rejection #academia #job #funding

If you don't get rejected daily, you are not trying.This sounds very cliche. But I have realized a bit more recently.Sometimes we complain about our problems and how nothing is working.Then we meet someone and they kind of have "the strong silent type" personality. The term is self-explanatory. They look strong, listen more than they talk, and when they speak they ask the right questions.This made me wonder, are these people struggling? Do they get rejected? Why don't they complain as much as I do?I realized that we all feel the same during the day. But perspective and reaction make all the difference.I definitely cannot force myself not to feel something, but I can always react differently to the way I feel.Your reaction to your problems is linked to your perspective.If you decide to look at failure as the end of it, then you will not try again.I say, try, fail, and move forward.What do you think?#people #rejection #perspective #strongsilenttype

The classic lines we hate to hear...'We're not the right fit''Unfortunately, but...''I can't commit right now because...'Or even worse - you hear nothing! 👻Isn't it frustrating how rejection can make us question our ability and think - am I good enough? Can I really do this??Just because you're not a good fit for one client doesn't mean the next one won't be the perfect match! You just haven't found your target audience so don't take the rejection to heart, learn from the experience and know that the 𝙧𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙩 client is just around the corner 💫 #experience #rejection #virtualassistance #setbacks #virtualassistantservices #virtualassistant #outsourcing #adminsupport #onlinebusiness #onlinebusinessmanager #fridaymotivation #clients

Happy #MilSpouseMonday! Jobseekers, let's talk about rejection. Learning to handle rejection is one of the most important skills you can develop in your job search. Seeing the words “We’ve decided to move forward with other candidates” in an email never feels good but unfortunately rejection is inevitable. Developing resilience, grit, and making the most of rejection will help you succeed in the long run.  3 tips to get over rejection. 1.     Ask for feedback – The hiring manager may or may not decide to give feedback, but it is always worth the ask. If feedback is given you can use this information to improve upon your job search. 2.     Keep connections open with your interviewer –I know it’s frustrating you didn’t get the job, but the hiring manager might circle back with you in the future with additional opportunities. Ultimately, handle your job rejection professionally to avoid burning any potential bridges as it may pay off in the long run. 3.     Remember, every interview is a positive learning experience – Keep going, and don’t give up! Learn from what you did wrong and improve upon that in your next interview. Job rejections can be valuable lessons and steer you in the right direction towards finding a job that is a good fit for you, so try not to be too hard on yourself and recognize your strengths and celebrate your small wins too.For more job-seeking assistance register for Hire Heroes USA's Serving Spouses Program today at: www.hireheroesusa.org Our Serving Spouses Program is open to all spouses including active-duty spouses, national guard spouses, reserve spouses, Gold Star spouses, and spouses of veterans.#rejection #jobsearchtips #servingspouses #milspouses

A hospital or practice depends on good doctors and caregivers but for any practice to run smoothly a free and regular cash flow is equally important. Revenue cycle depends on efficient coding and billing professionals who identify correct codes for every service offered to a patient, process bills and submit claims to insurance providers. Hiring trained staff for coding and billing processes might be a good idea for big setups like hospitals but for private practitioners and small practices it might not be a wise decision as it increases the financial burden and losses. For such practices, it is always better to go for outsourced medical billing as it reduces cost and improves cash flow as they are specialists in handling all billing issues and claim settlements.

Fear can protect us from real danger, but also keep us from going after what we really want in life.Many of us fear judgment, rejection, and failure. We tell ourselves everything that could go wrong and then question whether we’re good enough to overcome all of the possible challenges. The result…🌸 We don’t apply for the job we want. 🌸 We never start that business we’ve been dreaming about. 🌸 We don’t ask for help when we’re overwhelmed or just don’t understand. 🌸 We hide who we really are. 🌸 We don’t say what we believe/feel. What has fear kept you from doing? Comment below or DM for encouragement. #fear #judgment #rejection #failure

Jealousy is unattractive on anyone.  Instead Choose to be Inspired and encourage your Self to become a Better Version of your Self. There is no such thing as Rejection.  It is simply Realignment to what is meant for you.Sometimes we are Gifted someone for a short time, that is out of our Reach so that we can see what we can be Capable of, when we Try.  When someone Denies us our Attention, we are to Respect that and give them their Peace.  It is not Personal.   Love is not Ownership.  Love is Freedom. Love is Peace. Love is Respect. The more popular we are, the more attention we will have, both negative and positive.None of this attention is Personal either.  The Attention that we receive from others is a Direct reflection of what is inside them. This is Universal Law. 🙏🏽 When someone is trying to make you feel bad, they are torn inside.When they accuse you of being a bad parent, they know that they are one. When they call you names, it is how they feel about their Self.  (Fraud/liar/cheat)When someone is cheating on you, they will accuse you of cheating. We are literally billboards of our Mental health, everywhere we go.Our body is a reflection of our Choices.Our communication with others is a mirror to how we feel about our self. Our job shows our Moral compass.Our home shows our Values.The louder we are, the more unhealthy we are. I am truly sorry for those that I have hurt by denying their advances in the past. It is necessary to know that I have been raped more than once and repeatedly said no both of these times.  So, when men would get too close, sometimes after saying no to other men that same night, or them not taking a hint, i would have enough and demand that they stop. To which point I have been accused of being a bitch and insensitive. Women struggle with boundaries, because no is not respected and it is difficult saying no loud enough to get it into a man’s head without being aggressive. I am sorry to all men that have had their feelings hurt, but more so, I am so sorry to all of the women that have “hurt” a man’s feelings and become the target of aggressive, abusive language and behavior. This is unacceptable under any circumstance and shows just how toxic men are and they are ignorant to change it.  They are demanding and entitled.  They are arrogant and feel that their needs are more important than the feelings, safety and mental and spiritual health of women. Satan is Relentless and so is the Ungodly, emasculated man.

The first time I was ghosted after a lengthy interview process was 2005, and it was the best thing that could've happened to me 3 years into my design career. The interview process took a full month. 📞 First, the phone-screen with HR.🎨 Next, a solo interview with a manager.☎️ Then, a panel interview where 4 different people barked questions into a speaker-phone. 🖥 And finally, a series of timed tests on grammar, layout, color, etc.It was a very stressful experience. But I still really wanted the job. They told me I was a top candidate, and I should hear back the following week. 🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼❌ The email never came. ❌ The call never came. ❌ The offer never came.WHY were they ignoring me all of a sudden? Was I really so worthless that they couldn’t be bothered to type a single email? 😖I followed up multiple times, trying to reach someone—ANYONE. I cried, felt angry and confused, but eventually moved on to ace an interview for a Sr. Designer role because I had all that practice.🔥🔥🔥 NOW THIS IS THE PART WHERE IT GETS WILD.... ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️Fast-forward 10 years: I was an Art Director in an agency that was acquired. During my first week in the newly combined office, I sat near a designer I didn’t know, and it wasn’t long before I discovered that SHE was the designer who actually GOT THAT JOB back in 2005. 🤯🤯🤯And she told me everything I was NOT missing. It was a job that had just about crushed her spirit as a designer, and had a lasting effect on her mental health and self-worth. Ghosting was only the tip of the iceberg in that toxic environment. I was upset for her, and knew that it could've easily been me. 😳 There is NEVER an excuse for ghosting, but the next time you are ghosted, know that it has nothing to do with you OR your value as a creative.  It’s simply an organization’s way of telling you that you wouldn’t be treated well if you were hired. And that you deserve better. 💖🎨🌟#creativecareers #ghosting #rejection #jobsearchadvice #jobapplications #mentalhealthmatters #designerslife #interviews #designjobs #designcareer #rockthatcreativejob

If there is one thing that having been an entrepreneur has taught me, it's #rejection isn't personal.The same way potential small business clients wanted to work with me, but I wasn't in their #budget, larger corporations want to work with me but I am not in their budget at this time.It's not personal, but it does create a challenge.I thank God I am #resilient and have my eyes wide open, because the same way I won't budge on my #salaryexpectations I won't budge on my career efforts either. I know the value I bring and the value I deserve, so I will await until all the cards align (#salary, #workculture, #autonomy, #leadership, #employeeengagement, #midlevel, #worklifebalance, #diversity, #equity, and #flexibility).That said, I implore all #jobseekers to stay strong and #keeppushing.

The wound of rejection shows up in relationships as follows..1.The first and most obvious one is rejection by your partners. The men you like are not interested in starting a relationship with you.2.You attract men who try to change you: “you could lose a few kilos”, “you could be more feminine” and you easily question yourself because deep down you also believe that something is wrong with you.3.When love comes to the door, you simply don’t believe it. No matter how much the man proves his love for you, you will not be convinced.4.You try to present a perfect image and hide your flaws to avoid your partner discovering who you really are, i.e. a human being with wounds and weaknesses (Ps: you are just like everyone else). This constant pressure prevents you from really connecting with your partner.5.For fear of rejection you avoid getting involved with men you are really interested in. You choose safety.6.When your relationship is in crisis or conflict, you choose the escape strategy, the extreme solution (breaking up) or you reject the other person outright, for fear that they will reject you.If this fear of rejection is strong, you may also totally reject love in your life.https://lnkd.in/djsS7CSm#eveletsequeira #eveletslwa #woundofrejection #rejection #relationshipcoach

We may encounter many defeats but we must not be defeated. – Maya Angelou You might have failed at some point or another in your life. Possibly you were broken and devastated at that moment, but did your life end at that point? Obviously, no! That defeat was a mere part of your life that probably existed just to make you even stronger, both physically and mentally. You should know that there can be a lot of such failure moments in your life and better, be prepared to face it with a strong motivation. Be ready to rejection and make a habit of greeting it with an even unbeatable and stubborn plan. Make sure to bounce back harder every time a failure pushes you away from your goal. Such defeats can be innumerable in your life but it depends on you whether you give it the power to actually defeat you. Know that no one can break you when you have strong willpower.

When a woman resists a man's solutions:When a woman resists a man’s solutions he feels his competence is being questioned.As a result, he feels mistrusted, unappreciated, and stops caring. His willingness to listen understandably lessens.A man at such times can instead understand why she is
 resisting him. By clearly understanding that his timing and delivery are being rejected and not his solutions, a
 man can handle a woman’s resistance much better.To practice listening without offering any solutions is, however,
 a big step. #man #woman #problem #solution #caring #rejection #understanding #react #repost #commentThis is the end of Chapter 2.Below pics are some examples of ways a man might invalidate feelings or offer unwanted solutions:

Not that long ago, having a 9-5 job was considered success. Having health insurance, 401K, and the ability to move up, and a two-week vacation. There is a new generation showing up in the workforce. One that says” • Who would want to be at the same company for that long? • Why work for a company that would just lay me off? • Why sit in a cube someplace when I can work on my own from home? • Vacations, I don’t need to go anyplace, I have seen them all on Google. I have already driven on the streets of L.A. in Grand Theft Auto. • Why would I need to go outside and play? I have virtual Football on my Play Station. Success today is more about being a #polymath independent of one title, role, authority or restraint.In the 60’s #Astronauts where most admired, 80’90’s musical artist and actors become #1, now, it’s the people who are considered #disruptors , #Neuro-Hackers, #Influencer, and #Gamers, along with #YouTube #personalities. These are the images and voices pushing the #narrative to second guess career choices.Those who are looking for #jobs are #battling the false sense of #security  while #distrusting the #stability of any job they go out for. All the while, facing #rejection letters as they compete for that one job opening with over 200 applicants. What are companies and leaders to do? The real question is, what are you going to do? Looking at the picture, what level are you on right now? What level do you want to be on? My love for neuroscience, NLP, and Behavioral coaching drew me to the reality that the subconscious is the key to understanding the self. The science behind self-discovery is truly the root to all new ways of discussing sales, service, brand, and personal development.#coaching #success #people #job #work #personaldevelopment #science #nlp #juliansado #pivot2change #neuroscience #behavioralscience #subconsciousmind #sales #service #brand

Did you fail to get the job you wanted after your last interview? This could be a sign you need to boost your interview confidence, or increase your preparationIf you did have all of the correct qualifications and experience for the role you wanted, the problem could be with your technique. Lack of confidence during an interview is a common reason why around 40% of candidates don’t make it past the first interview stage. Look back over the conversation you had with the hiring manager. Were you constantly fidgeting, looking down at your CV, or failing to make eye contact? Your body language in an interview can say a lot about your kind of person and how confident you feel in your abilities. Try practising with a friend or colleague to prepare for your next interview. Make a list of common interview questions similar to the ones you were asked in your last interview, and practice responding to them. Come up with competency-based answers which showcase your abilities and the skills your hiring managers are looking for. Most importantly, practice demonstrating an air of positive self-esteem. Sit straight, keep your hands still, and make eye contact regularly. A smile can go a long way in an interview too. #Recruitment4U #jobsearch #Interview #interviewrejection #rejection #Recruitment #partnerships #trustwww.recruitment4u.com.auFor the full blog click the link below  https://lnkd.in/g8HDab7S

Even if you liked the idea of the role you were applying for and thought it would be good for your career, you may not have been perfectly positioned for the job. Take another look at the job description and highlight the qualifications the manager was looking for. Do they match your education and experience perfectly? If not, this could be a sign it wasn’t what you did in the interview that lost you the opportunity. No matter how confident you appear during the interview, most hiring managers will still prioritise candidates with the right qualifications.

ZAŠTO SADA, A NE PRIJE? PUTOVANJE DO CILJA KROZ NISKOFREKVENTNA PONAŠANJA POPUT ODBIJANJA: U mojoj knjizi VIBRACIJSKO UMIJEĆE - ALAT ZA STVARANJE VAŠE STVARNOSTI - https://lnkd.in/dXnA3Kg, sam napisala da se UTJECAJEM UVJERENJA NA EMOCIJE I LJUDSKO PONAŠANJE bavim od 1984. godine kada sam postala SUTKINJA.Na to su me INSPIRIRALI ljudi kojima sam sudila (81% uvjetnih osuda), a za koje sam zaključila da NISU POTPUNO NESVJESNI PONAŠANJA ZA KOJE SE OPTUŽUJU.U početku je to bilo UČENJE TEORIJE LJUDSKOG PONAŠANJA, a 1996. godine je preraslo u PRAKTIČNI RAD NA SEBI.Te sam godine započela FREUDOVU GRUPNU PSIHOANALIZU koju sam nakon 3 godine nastavila INDIVIDUALNOM JUNGOVOM PSIHOANALIZOM.2008. godine sam započela INTUITIVNO REPROGRAMIRANJE UVJERENJA I EMOCIJA, kojim se bavim i danas, jer je to po meni najbolja TEHNIKA PROMJENE LJUDSKOG PONAŠANJA koju sam učila i prakticirala.Kako mi (kolege s kojima to radim od 2008.) SVAKODNEVNO PRAKTICIRAMO ovu tehniku ​​i na sebi i na drugima, SVAKODNEVNO DOLAZIMO DO NOVIH OTKRIĆA NA TOM PODRUČJU.Jedno od njih se odnosi na ODBIJANJE KAO NAČIN PONAŠANJA, odnosno KOJE JE KLJUČNO UVJERENJE U NJEGOVOJ POZADINI I KOJE EMOCIJE TO UVJERENJE PRIVLAČI.O tome bi se moglo puno pričati, ali čini se da je tako kompleksno znanje od praktične koristi samo ljudima koji se bave PREVENCIJOM SUKOBA, NJIHOVIM MIRNIM RJEŠAVANJEM I POSTKONFLIKTNOM REHABILITACIJOM.Ono što je važno za CIJELU POPULACIJU je da je odbijanje po svojoj prirodi (naravno za one koji tako vjeruju) POKAZATELJ NAŠEG ŽIVOTNOG SMJERA.Ono nam omogućuje da učimo BEZ DA SE NEGDJE TRAJNO ZAUSTAVIMO PRIJE NEGO ŠTO SMO NAUČILI CIJELU LEKCIJU.Odbijanje NAS OSLOBAĐA STRAHA OD POGREŠKE jer nas drugi odbijaju UMJESTO DA SAMI DONESEMO ODLUKU KOJA MOŽE BITI POGREŠNA.Odbijanjem ODREĐUJEMO OSOBNE GRANICE MOĆI po principu IDEMO DOK NAS NE ZAUSTAVE.U kolektivnom smislu, ODBIJANJE JE U KORIJENU RATOVA I OSVAJANJA.Ljudi koji imaju program DA SE NIKADA NE VRAĆAJU TAMO GDJE SU JEDNOM BILI ODBIJENI imaju TRAUME KOJE IH s jedne strane ŠTITE OD NOVIH TRAUMA, a s druge strane SPREČAVAJU DA PONOVE ISKUSTVO KOJE JE PROIZVELO TRAUMU.Ovi ljudi NE MOGU OPROSTITI jer NEOPRAŠTANJE IH ŠTITI OD NOVIH TRAUMA KOJE BI MORALI OPROSTITI.Međutim, oni koji PROMIJENE UVJERENJA NA KOJIMA SE TEMELJI ODBIJANJE MOGU OPROSTITI I BITI PRIHVAĆENI TAMO GDJE SU BILI ODBIJENI, I OBRATNO.#odbijanje #promjenuvjerenja #promjenaosjećaja #promjenaponašanja #prihvaćanje #equilibrium #jasnicaclaramatic

" I am not rejecting you but the topic, these are two different things remember that" from my former Research supervisor. There are several words that leave a bad taste in one's mouth, #rejection is at the top of that list especially when you are at the receiving end. In one way or the other it is an inevitable #experience, like an unwanted freebie for a certain purchase.Indeed it is avoidable, how? Don't try anything.😂Jokes aside, you could perfect what is going to get scrutinized but this isn't fireproof either. If we can't run from it then what should be of importance is how to brace for impact and get up again.The first sentence is something I think can help, separating oneself from the idea, project, application and what not.A #NO to your submission is just that...a no to your submission.A #NO from your dream company doesn't translate as "you are not good enough as a person"  but  "they have other options".I am neither trying to sugarcoat anything nor mince words... truth is if it is something you have dedicated a lot to and believe in, a negative response can crush you and rightly so, let it hurt but not to a point of no return(is all this person is trying to say).What #helps with recovery is realizing that your #work, #achievements, #resume may come from you but they are not you. So any critical views on them can be taken without feeling attacked or less than and can help with improving before the next attempt.また後で👋🏼😊Sources:Video clips from #Pexels ( #Unsplash is always at heart).😂 Please support the owners by following their work, when you check it out.Song: Tightrope by the ScoreNote: The editing might be off..not to say the others were any better. 😂🙈

Getting turned down for a job you really wanted in your job research (to Switzerland) can be painful, especially if you send multiple applications and you received job rejection emails which are often so informal, Indeed A significant number of employers don't even bother to notice their decision to applicants.  But this time  I'would like to thank this employer and express my gratitude for the well-writing email rejection and for the good impression he left me by reading it. This company recognizes the strengths,, encourages to apply and maintains a relationship that 's positively impact her reputation. #job #research #gratitude #writing #rejection #reputation #well-writing #turndown #answer #negative #jobseeker #switzerland

Overcome Rejection course was designed and created because I personally experienced rejection all throughout my life, to the point where I expected to be rejected. So, I would either withdrawal within myself or handled it in an inappropriate manner.  It was not until I had one of many come to Jesus’ moments and it was revealed to me that the root of my rejection began even before I was in my mother’s womb and the root continued to grow while I was in grade school, in the military, in my marriage, and after I rededicated my life to Christ. Once, I understood why God allowed me to get rejected all throughout my life. I started to see it from a different perspective. Each time I was rejected, it was growing me to be prepared for what I was going to be doing for the Kingdom of God.  Understanding, that people were going to reject me, and I had to know how to handle it and not allow it to get me off course. I had to begin to set my face like a diamond which is stronger than flint to be able to withstand the rejection I would experience when I began to allow God to use me as a vessel. A vessel that may say things that people do not like even though my messages would come from God mostly after I have been through a time of fasting and prayer. "I have made your forehead like a diamond, harder than flint. Don’t be afraid of them or discouraged by the look on their faces, though they are a rebellious house.” – Ezekiel 3:9 CSB So, I created a 5 lesson, self-paced Overcome Rejection Course that teaches how to no longer allow rejection to hold you in spiritual bondage, hindering you from clearly understanding that rejection, is not meant to break you, it is meant to grow you.Purchase for a limited time, the discounted price of $47 USD. https://bit.ly/OvercomeRCIt’s time, to no longer allow rejection to hold you in spiritual bondage.

Even if you liked the idea of the role you were applying for and thought it would be good for your career, you may not have been perfectly positioned for the job. Take another look at the job description and highlight the qualifications the manager was looking for. Do they match your education and experience perfectly? If not, this could be a sign it wasn’t what you did in the interview that lost you the opportunity. No matter how confident you appear during the interview, most hiring managers will still prioritise candidates with the right qualifications. If you continue applying for similar roles in the future, the best thing you’ll be able to do now is start working on adding to your skills. Make a list of all the talents and educational credentials you don’t already have and start seeking them out.

See, while we hold the #purest intention for everyone, but often tend to project our #frustration by #criticizing people when they are not our way. Criticism has #vibrations of #anger or #rejection, so apart from creating #hurt in the one being criticized, it #depletes our inner #power.

Not hearing from someone may be a worse feeling than rejection. At least with rejection, you’d have closure, right? Here’s the list we’ve developed on how to get people to respond to you. It can’t guarantee success, but at least you can move forward. https://lnkd.in/g8nNdxKp#communication #teamwork #collaboration #ghosting #learning #rejection
