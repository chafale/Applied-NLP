Some goodbye’s are very difficultToday was a sad and difficult day.We said good bye to our beloved furry son Al E Baba.As I had written a while ago, some goodbye’s are easy. But this goodbye was difficult.Sudden accelerated kidney failure but still my boy whom I have had for 14.5 years still had a final smile before he said goodbye.I’m extremely sad, in tears and broken.Al E Baba, the White Rajah of Borneo, came to us from a puppy mill barely 7 weeks old. But over the years, he become a part of our family.I know he is in heaven now, and I’ll see him again one day. But a little part of me is gone. And I will miss him everyday for the rest of my life. It will get easier over time but nothing can fill the gap that is left in my heart. And this is where I will need to seek God to help me fill the gap with loving and joyful memories. Now I cry, I mourn and I pray for God’s love and peace.I love you my good and faithful son, I miss you and I am so thankful for you to be such an important part of my life. I will see you again in Heaven. I feel this is a message Al E may write to me from heaven:My dear family on earth,If I could write from heaven, this is what I'd say,Please don't miss me too much,I'm with you throughout your day.You may not see or hear me,but if your quiet and still, You may just feel my presence;because, in Heaven, there is free will.Don't worry for the day,it will come and go as planned,Enjoy each moment you are given,keep worry from your hand.Keep sorrow to a minimum;For in Heaven if you could see,You'd know I'm safe and happy,I did not cease to be.Moments in time are brief,until we'll be together again,as Eternity lasts forever,our lives, they have no end.#lost #love #death #mourning #furryson #faithful #sad #melanchohly

The 𝟭𝟵𝘁𝗵 𝗼𝗳 𝗡𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿 is the I𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗠𝗲𝗻'𝘀 𝗗𝗮𝘆.Did you know?I bet you did not! If you did, how did you celebrate it?I waited and scrolled long enough today through my social media channels to find someone mentioning it - I got nothing and I am #sad! Actually, no, I got a meme from a friend - the kind that makes you laugh and cry at the same time (check comments).Why are we not celebrating men?What does this say about the society we live in and our values?What does this say to the young generation about men and becoming (a decent) one?Why are we forgetting all the beautiful, necessary, irreplaceable roles and traits that men contribute to humanity?A sad joke - if anything, this speaks of the way we take things to extremes! Somebody tell 'feminists', snowflakes, and keyboard warriors (whatever they call themselves - God knows they have a thing with identity tags) that there are no winners in a war against men and masculinity. Maybe, just maybe, we would be better off celebrating the beautiful aspects of manhood (and starting to raise some) rather than ignoring/fighting/condemning men!𝗗𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗠𝗲𝗻, 𝗜 𝗰𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗯𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂, 𝗜 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗵 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗲𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗼𝗻𝗲, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗵𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗮𝘁 𝗹𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲, 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗳𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗹𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘀 - 𝘀𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲, 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗳𝘂𝗹, 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁, 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗲, 𝗰𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗴,  𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝗱, 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀! 𝗧𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗸 𝘆𝗼𝘂! (Save me the lectures on toxic masculinity, and all that men have done for thousands of years - I know and it doesn't change my standing against what we are presently doing/educating men, nor that this day should be as celebratory as women's day!)

I think in. previous life I may have been a bear 🐻 or a hedgehog 🦔 Or it may simply be that I'm solar powered!At this time of year, when the access to daylight is less, I struggle. It's known as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). I struggle to get out of bed when it's dark outside - my body just tells me it's time to sleep or hibernate!Living in the North West of England, it's not known for being sunny!I have a daylight alarm clock, which gradually does a sunrise from a deep dark red to a bright white light over a half-hour period before the radio kicks in! And I have a SAD light on my desk! Which feels like I'm sitting inside the sun! I try to have it on for about 20mins each morning as I'm going through my emails. And I also make sure I take vitamin D supplements due to the decreased sunshine. These changes have made the world of difference to me since I implemented them back in 2020. The alarm clock even helped me feel more awake and less tired when I had to get up at 0445 to drop someone off at the airport.What do you do to make the shorter days more bearable? Or are you unaffected by them?#SAD #seasonalaffectivedisorder #ithinkimsolarpowered #wakemeupinspring #hibernationtime

#shraddhawalker #gruesomemurder #sad #learning #women What hapenned is super sad and deeply shocked one and all! It’s highly important for Women to learn and “early Quit” an Abusive relationship, be it verbal or physical, be it personal or professional. Coz..1) It’s good to be a fighter or healer but at the same time it’s important to be practical! How can u change someone who has been like this for 25-30 yrs.. In reality, noone changes.2) Such things only grow with time. Don’t waste the best years of your life in rolling with a pig and draining urself out. Absolutely not worth it!3) Nothing is bigger than U & ur dignity! Keep urself before everything else.4) Its not very smart to be only listening to ur heart… Striking a good sense of balance between heart and head is always the key.5) There is no need to leave evrything - ur job, ur parents, ur town. If it’s true love, you both will find mutual common grounds without having one to sacrifice it all.***You can never walk into light, if you dont learn to walk out of darkness! That Power of timely Decisiveness, u need to Gather for urself, u owe it to urself***

Are you a queen of the night or a sunshine junkie ?  It's strange being back in the UK during this time of the yearThe earliest it gets dark at home up the mountain is 6pm so tbh It was a it of a shock to come back to this.Each day,  a little darker...4.30 is the new 6.30! On a more serious note though, many of us really struggle with out a regular  fix of sunshine. (or even just day light(but if you work all day that can seem imposible to get)  We can't all move to sunier shores, (although I do honestly recommend doing jst that...)but there are many things that we can do to help beat the winter blues.  What do you do to beat the lack of light and winter blues?  I'll share some ideas in the comments #wellness #wellbeing #midlife #menopause #mentalhealth #SAD

I’ve always been interested by the epidemiology of mental health concerns in other cultures and the changes in prevalences. It’s amazing how something as simple as increasing omega-3 and vitamin D can have such a positive effect, also providing a bit more understanding and insight as to why countries that consume more fish and supplement vitamin D tend to have lower rates of depression and stress! #mentalhealthsupport #psychology #SAD

Anonymous Story ❤ Health and Safety Authority failings - Not Good Enough - We need change - We are not being protected it dawned on me whilst attending the Human Rights Conference on Friday when speakers were providing the steps that should be taken after a bullying experience and how to contact the Health and Safety Authority. I thought I might share a story.An individual had a very serious situation at work whereby they highlighted workplace bullying as well as workplace serious financial wrongdoing which left them in a very precarious position.The individual was forced into investigation which was not in line with the current legislation the Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work which came into effect by way of Statutory Instrument on 23 December 2020 (Code).The individual had been approached by the perpetrator one week after making the complaint, she was on her own and felt threatened with the result she was signed off by the Doctor.Long story short the individual was totally terrified as within the investigation she would have to mention colleagues.The individual contacted the HSA and sent in a total of over 15 emails begging them to contact the employer. 3 weeks later was transferred to the contact centre, the contact centre requested proof of new Legislation, it was not in place and informed the company of changes required. Nothing else was done, the employee returned to work, no code of practice in sight. They contacted the chairman - did not receive a reply. However, action was taken their Company implemented the new Code of practice.The individual felt the system had totally failed them and brought it to the Office of the Ombudsman Ireland attention.The Office of the Ombudsman Ireland  excepted the complaint due to non reply by the Chair. The Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint they found it acceptable that an individual should:-Wait 3 weeks sending 15 emails and several calls to be transferred to the contact centreThe only action taken was a review of the code of practice which was many years out of dateThat a non reply from a Chair to be acceptable The HSA did not carry out a full investigation even though the individual mentioned had form and the HSA were informed of this. #work #experience #share #healthandsafety #humanrights #wecandobetter #people #culture #stopbullying #beaforceforgood #sad #betterworkinglivesforall

I was absolutely right about the world when I was being with someone.Everyday, felt myself luckiest guy to get her in my life and always consider a part of my life.I had different perception about commitments, feelings, affections, attractions and love.I was a diligent, studios and soft hearted kind of obedient kid but there was a kid around me we're not look hppy and looked down upon themThat smile, that happiness and that level of excitement gone somewhere which I always afraid to loss.How would I tell the world or her that how precious you are for me and what's your mean to being in my life. Last few months wasn't easy and deeply exhausted me in each and every way. Something That gave me such level of pain which couldn't even experienced before.Each and every day, i felt like someone stolen my smile and it won't come again.But during this the person who knows everything without even telling her is my Mom.She has a special kind of quality to observe everything what's going on in my life and pretended to be like you know nothing and try all of her best efforts nd things for me which brings my life back on track.Dear Mom, no one knows my condition better that you. I would not even return you back what you did so far for me.Thank you Maa, Thank you for being with me nowAnd Thank you for Everything ♥️#love #feelings #commitment #realtionships #maa #care #sad #happiness #moment #life

Is it just me that sometimes gets a little bit #sad when I come to the end of a cohort of #LiinkedIn students, a project, or some work?I get very invested in helping, seeing  them evolve, almost like watching little birds emerge and fly off into the success they deserve and it is great ... but then the series ends and I only get to see them through LinkedIn and feel like a proud parent.I've just finished a 12 week programme with another few cohorts from the world of #insurance and they have done really well. Really pleased to see and already hear from them how well they have been working, the homework they have been up to and already some clients that they have won on the back of the training - #aceTomorrow is a new set, a leadership team in a utility company that I have been researching and watching for some weeks and I cannot wait to meet them in real life, yep 3d and face to face to see what they're like for real.

The fire was deliberately lit by FTX Digital Markets and has backdrafted onto the FTX tree. This large tree has now become a large gathering of ashes. The smoke and debris is expanding the fire. The fire is now moving slowly and will destroy all in its path, especially the small trees that were somewhat connected to the FTX US tree.I note: Many people spoke out months ago about the fire that was being fuelled with FTX US lies and deception that came from the top.Questions:1. Where were the fire brigade to put out the fire before it took hold?2. What happened to oversight and accountability?3. What happens to those that have been burned and the many more who will lose everything? 🙏 😔 #cryptonews #ftx #ftxcrash #bankruptcy #sad

After marriage he cares his wife and child. He has no time for yourselfWhy every time people say that you are a man and you can not cry, WHY? Is he not a human being? OR Doesn't he have feelings and emotions.If he talks to a girl, people talk about ‘SANSKAR’.Why everybody always look suspicious?SAD 😓 #mensday #internationalmensday2022 #man #sad

Jesienna depresja - (SAD)Czy jesienno-zimowe przygnębienie może świadczyć o sezonowej depresji, znanej również jako sezonowe zaburzenie afektywne (ang. seasonal affective disorder, SAD)? A może to tylko przejściowe obniżenie nastroju, jesienna chandra związana z mniejszą ilością światła słonecznego i deszczową aurą?Niestety tak. Depresja sezonowa to zaburzenie pojawiające się zwykle w okresie jesienno-zimowym, zazwyczaj około października, i ustępujące w okresie wiosenno-letnim. Może trwać od kilku tygodni do nawet kilku miesięcy. Wspomniane wyżej objawy mają zwykle charakter łagodny lub umiarkowany. Oprócz tych wspomnianych można dodać również: wzmożoną senność w dzień, zaburzenia snu w nocy, nadmierny apetyt prowadzący do wzrostu masy ciała czy poczucie, że nic nas nie cieszy. Dodatkowo możemy mieć problemy z koncentracją, odczuwać zniechęcenie, a nawet bóle mięśni. Jeżeli takie objawy pojawiają się cyklicznie od 2-3 lat, należy udać się do psychologa. #Depresja #depresjasezonowa #psycholog #sad

I don't think there is anyone who never makes a mistake in his or her life. We all experience failures of one kind or another, to varying degrees. What is important is the spirit of the community that celebrates and supports those who have failed. I believe that those who have experienced pain and suffering are the ones who will be able to give hope to many people in the future. I believe that age, gender, nationality, origin, religious beliefs, past or present economic situation are irrelevant to transform.I believe that the most important thing is our determination to change our present situation and to change our future. I believe that we need to find the diamond in the rough that lurks within us and our society.Ham bhavishy badal sakate hain#transformation #secondchance #transform #regret #restart #individuals #couple #family#nevergiveup #encouragement #dharma #determination #dream #desire #drugs #community #helping #support #change #society #purpose #life #joy #happiness #unhappiness #prosperity #diversity #components_of_happiness #education #fund #wealth #job #upstander #bystander #passion #diamond #resource #human #capital #human_capitalism #social_capital #donation #peer #friend #mentoring #counseling #consulting #business #india #japan #usa #global #meaning #homeless #contributor #future #development #overcome #fear #anger #disruptive #smile #sad #love #hope #people #experience #heal #hardship #difficulty #reform #dad #mom #granpa #granma #redefine #redesign #power_of_community #local #forgotten_value #engineering #humanity #warm #emotion #mindset #growthmindset #positive_change #thewaytheytreatweakpeopleshowstheirtruenature #money #intrinsic_value #dharmatic #revive_value #ikigai_for_everyboy #humane #generosity #righteousness #love_hope_and_joy_for_humanity #son #daughter #wayoflife #growth #love_and_hope_for_humanity #generation #child #parents #reverseengineering #purpose_of_life #ikigai #alcohol #crime #journey_to_find_a_role_to_shine #life #pursuitofhappiness #spirit #leland #jane #sanfrancisco

Don't suffer in silence.It's been suggested previously* that almost 1 in 3 people suffer from SAD to some extent in the UK.Here are some things that you could try to help:🧠 Natural light, can greatly affect your overall mood, so spend some time each day outside if you can, and open your curtains to let as much light in as possible. 🧠 Physical activity can boost your self-esteem and help you concentrate, sleep and feel better.  So push yourself to move more. Get up from behind your desk as often as possible.🧠Try to reframe what you think about the dark days. Research has shown that reframing how we think about stressful events can help us better deal with them. 🧠Of course try talking about your feelings to a friend, family member, health professional or counsellor as this can greatly benefit you also. #sad #useyournoggin #mood #mentalhealth #lowenergy #vitamind3 #research #health *Weather Channel & You Gov 2014

Because we all need a hug Do you know how the Mood Bears began ?!!3 years ago during a difficult time, there was nothing that could take away such sad feelings. Sleepless nights were so long, so drawing to pass the time helped . Happy bear came to life from a doodle and his bright yellow fur like the sunshine and soft warm cuddle made those sad feeling feel so much better.The bears grew to a family of 8 and the mission to put back lost smiles became reality. The Bears are helping millions world wide and we will continue our focus to keep helping each and every one that needs help when nothing else is helping ❤️🐻 #selfie #mood #moodbear #sad #happy #hope #calm #kind #selflove #anxiety #anxious #mentalhealth #rainbow #gift #christmas #giftideas #love #toys #toyshop #toyphotography

Article by BuzzFeed News. ✨"Decades of evidence suggest that shorter, darker days are associated with chemical changes in the brain that can cause people to feel lethargic, withdraw socially, and lose interest in enjoyable activities. It's commonly referred to as the “#winterblues,” but there’s also a more serious, diagnosable condition called #seasonalaffectivedisorder, or #SAD, which is a type of major #depression."

Yes, There Is Stigma Related to Mental Health Stigma, as it relates to mental health, is when people who experience mental illness are viewed or view themselves in a negative light. Mental health stigma can either be public stigma, self-stigma, or a combination of the two.  Public stigma includes stereotypes and discrimination held by the general population. A person can adopt public stigma and hold negative beliefs even before developing a mental illness.  Stereotypes include beliefs that people are responsible for their mental health issues or that those with mental illness are more likely to be dangerous.  Common forms of discrimination include denying someone housing or turning down someone for a job based on their mental health.  Self-stigma happens when someone with mental illness applies negative public views to themselves. They observe others’ negative attitudes. Often, they believe they are unworthy or should be able to control their symptoms through willpower.  When someone takes on beliefs like these, it’s easy for them to feel isolated, misunderstood, or that they’re the underdog. They may hesitate to apply for housing, get medical care, and participate in community activities.source: https://lnkd.in/geXVkFrjPlease like or share, if you choose to donate to my Movember page please visit https://lnkd.in/gaeCcen2Movember #Movember #menshealthmonth #help #donate #depressionawareness #sucideprevention #men #fyp #mental #health #sad #need #save #savelives #matter #light #healthmotivation #November #2022year #depression #work

I’m just going to take a break from a regular post for today. I would like to share just a little about mental/emotional health, and I want to hear from you! 🫵🏻As we get into winter here in Canada 🇨🇦many of us (yes I do too🙋🏻‍♀️) suffer from depression 😔aka S.A.D. Seasonal affective disorder is no joke and can really play havoc on one’s mind and emotions. I’m not afraid to admit 🫢that I’ve suffered for years with seasonal depression, it can really drag a person down let me tell you. With the stress and busyness of the holiday season coming up does not help either. The reason why I am reaching out 🤝🏻is to remind people that there is support out there for you! If this is a problem for you, I ask that you please get the help you require to get you through! You may need something more like medication or treatment but even the smallest of things like talking 🗣️to a family member or friend or even to your physician or counsellor or therapist! Don’t stay quiet and suffer alone🤫, reach out to someone/anybody. That being said I like to get outside and get fresh air and walk🚶🏻‍♀️. I try to exercise regularly and stick to a healthier diet of fruits 🍓and veggies 🥦( oh don’t worry I still eat chips and chocolate 🍫 and no I’m not a vegetarian I do eat meat 🥩 a few times a week, I just limit how often and portions). With doing this I find it helps me stay on track and stay healthy and happy! 😃What do you do to help beat S.A.D. and to stay motivated to do so??? I want to hear from you! #seasonaldepression #sad #stayhealthy

Depression is a multi-faceted disorder which encompasses a diversity of neuropsychological and socio-behavioral factors, with depressed individuals tending to experience a distorted perception of time. Depressive individuals find time passes slowly and are preoccupied with the past. The cause(s) of such disturbance remains to be investigated, with the nature of past events in life hypothesized to be a probable potentiating factor. The hypoactivity of the brain’s basal ganglia region, which is related to decreased response to positive stimuli, hence emotional valence, may be associated with subjective slowness of time as perceived by depressed subjects. Time distortion appears more pronounced in studies of long interval than short interval ranges. Time perception has a consolidating role which oversees and links various neuropsychological and socio-behavioral aspects of an individual’s internal interactions with the external world, therefore affecting one’s prognosis in depression. It also has a modulatory and interfering influence on perceptual objectivity due to its high sensitivity to emotional valence.source: https://lnkd.in/g6NHVrPT Please like or share, if you choose to donate to my Movember page please visit https://lnkd.in/gaeCcen2Movember #Movember #menshealthmonth #help #donate #depressionawareness #sucideprevention #men #fyp #mental #health #sad #need #save #savelives #matter #light #healthmotivation #November #2022year #depression #work

Animation Special Mention:With the recent passing of voice actor Kevin Conroy, I had been reminded of a somber moment from animation that helped me to truly grasp the concept of mortality and death when I was a child. Just as I wrote in the past about the episode Pigeon Man from "Hey Arnold", there are moments in animation that are not sorely about silly moments that make us laugh but to teach real life lessons that stay with us throughout our lives. In this instance the moment in question involves a moment from another classic Nickelodeon series "The Wild Thornberrys" in the episode Forget Me Not and an aging elephant named Rebecca. Forewarning: Keep a box of tissues at the ready. #animation #cartoon #television #sad #nickelodeon #thewildthornberrys #lifelessons #elephants

Did you know you can decrease your risk of death by simply living in sync with the seasons? 🍂🍃🌜🌨️😴☀️🏃🏾‍♀️🌱❤️‍🩹Winter can be hard.It’s cold, dark, and for many - lonely. It can easily wear our spirits down into depression. Keeping up our resilience at those times can feel like an uphill battle without the sunny delights of summer to see us through. But what if we stop battling? What if we lean into the wisdom of this time and ask what it can give us instead? We might find that longer evenings allow us to reflect and gain more clarity. We might learn that darkness brings more rest and recuperation, or even that loneliness creates space for nurturing ourselves. Research has shown that by syncing our own internal body clock to the great natural cycles of our external environment, we can lower our risk of multiple health conditions.This includes sleeping and waking rhythms, eating times, exercise, work routine and even when we have sex or use the bathroom! So let’s shift our perspective and value the ebbs as well as the flows. Let's embrace the winter season and learn how to live in sync with it to improve our physical and mental health. What will you do differently this winter? What habits and behaviours do you want to change? Read this article (link in comments) by Valentina Wright to learn how to synchronise our bodies to internal and external cycles, and live in greater harmony with nature.#health #cycles #winter #depression #SAD #circadianrhythm

From Projecthappiness.org:IT’S OKAY TO NOT BE OKAY. Let’s talk about how hard it is to open up to someone about being sad for “no reason”, how hard it is to explain to your friends and family that you have a heavy feeling that you can’t seem to shake. You're not alone. Optimism is powerful and motivational. But let’s not get into Toxic Positivity Land and pretend that everything is good when it isn’t. Allow yourself to feel what you feel, which ironically helps you move through it. Share your struggles to give others the space to share theirs. You are not “negative” - you are human! And that’s a good thing, even though it can be hard. Know that ALL your feelings count.#happiness #positivepsychology #optimism #negativity #emotions #mindset #emotionalintelligence #selfawareness #coaching #selfcare #sad #stressmanagement

The weather is finally starting to feel like fall! Sometimes, mood changes begin and end when the season changes - which is totally normal. SAD usually develops in adulthood, but it can also affect children and teens. Therefore, it’s important to recognize that depression symptoms may look very different in young people. Children and adolescents with SAD may have:- The presence of irritability. When we think of depression, sadness often comes to mind. However, depression in adolescents can also present anger, frustration, or general irritability.- Changes in sleep. While insomnia tends to be a symptom of depression in adults, children and teens may sleep more than usual or sleep at unusual hours of the day.- Feelings of low self-worth.

Buenas sensaciones sobre el futuro del Servicio de Ayuda a Domicilio (SAD) en Andalucía tras la mesa redonda en la que he participado hoy en Sevilla, junto a José Repiso, viceconsejero de Integración Social, Juventud, Familias e Igualdad de la Junta de Andalucía; David de la Encina, vicepresidente de la Comisión de Igualdad, Políticas Sociales y Conciliación de la Federación Andaluza de Municipios y Provincias (FAMP); Carmen Castilla, secretaria general de UGT Andalucía; y Nuria López, secretaria general de CCOO.Todos hemos coincidido en que urge encontrar una solución que garantice la prestación de este servicio esencial de manera perdurable en el tiempo, lo que en mi opinión pasa por acordar un convenio colectivo autonómico que tenga en cuenta las particularidades del SAD en Andalucía y las necesidades de sus trabajadoras. No en vano, hoy en día, a falta de ese convenio sectorial regional, en esa comunidad se aplica un convenio marco estatal que está poniendo contra las cuerdas a un sector que siempre ha operado con unos márgenes muy ajustados y que ahora, además, se ve obligado a asumir sobrecostes imprevistos y ajenos a su voluntad. Me ha alegrado comprobar que las empresas y los sindicatos estamos más cerca de lo que pudiera parecer, dada la predisposición de las secretarias generales de CCOO y UGT a sentarse a la mesa de diálogo para establecer las condiciones de un nuevo convenio. Y, además, estaré pendiente del anuncio realizado por el viceconsejero de la Junta, que ha afirmado que en unas semanas habrá noticias sobre la subida del precio del SAD en Andalucía para hacer frente al panorama económico actual, una revisión que probablemente se repetirá en el primer trimestre de 2023, según sus propias palabras. Ojalá el intercambio de opiniones de esta mañana se materialice en acuerdos que respondan al compromiso que empresas, sindicatos y Administración hemos adquirido con los usuarios y trabajadores del SAD. Todos los implicados debemos asumir nuestra parte de responsabilidad y encontrar una solución que beneficie a TODOS. #dependencia #SAD

Llevo media vida en el  SAD,. nunca tuve constancia de que existieran tantas #empresas que se dedicaban a la atención domiciliaria de las personas.De unos tres años paraca estoy conociendo multitud de ellas y me ha hecho pensar si la atención a las #personasmayoresendomicilio es el #negocio del #futuro .Después de estar trabajando en #sad se lo difícil que era y es encontrar profesionales cualificados para el desempeño de dichas funciones.Recuerdo cuando salió, la ley que todas las #auxiliares del SAD tenían que tener una titulación para poder realizar dicha labor. Por lo cual tenían que pasar unas pruebas para obtener dicha certificación o presentar una titulación de convalidación, en esa época dichas titulación eran #auxiliardeclinica o #enfermeria y un número de horas trabajadas.Recuerdo el primer día de la valoración, era para entregar papeles y para explicarnos cómo sería el proceso. Luego un segundo proceso ya que la mayoría éramos actas por horas trabajadas pero no por #formación, donde explicábamos las funciones y como las realizábamos sin problema, porque yo me había ido formando de forma autodidacta (siempre cuando me daban un servicio dependiendo de las características del mismo y grado de #dependencia me informaba y estudiaba las características de la #enfermedades ) hay que dejar claro que no solo trabajamos con #personasmayores.La tercera fase del proceso fue un examen tipo test  y  práctico (yo este último no lo tuve que realizar) superaba el número de horas,  por último uno oral que para acceder a el tenías que haber aprobado los dos primeros una vez hecho estos y habiendo sido acta  obtenidas el #certificadodeatencionsocisanitariaapersonasdependientesendomicilio.Han salido nuevas titulaciones en referencia al sector,  pero no veo que la preparación que obtiene sea la más adecuada (lo sé porque amigas de mi hija han estudiado el grado medio de #dependencia  ) y deja mucho.que desear a la hora de enfrentarse al #trabajo.Cursos de tres meses  a distancia, sin prácticas, mucha teoría y que valgan para trabajar , luego hay otros de la misma rama de formación, que no son válidos #criterios Todo esto viene porque estoy harta de oír que las #auxiliaresdelSAD, solo servimos para lavar culos perdón por la expresión, comprar y fregar, Quiero dejar muy claro que eso no es #verdad .Hoy lo dejo aquí porque hay tanto que contar pero......... Mi indignación es tan grande y mucho más que nadie salga a defender nuestra PROFESIONALIDAD .#demosluz #diasynochosperfectos #domusvi #lafunciondelsad #sad #sadactivo #somossadsomosvida

Adolescent and young adult men do poorly on indicators of mental health evidenced by elevated rates of suicide, conduct disorder, substance use, and interpersonal violence relative to their female peers. Data on global health burden clearly demonstrate that young men have a markedly distinct health risk profile from young women, underscoring different prevention and intervention needs. Evidence indicates that boys disconnect from health-care services during adolescence, marking the beginning of a progression of health-care disengagement and associated barriers to care, including presenting to services differently, experiencing an inadequate or poorly attuned clinical response, and needing to overcome pervasive societal attitudes and self-stigma to access available services. This review synthesizes key themes related to mental ill health in adolescent boys and in young adult men. Key social determinants are discussed, including mental health literacy, self-stigma and shame, masculinity, nosology and diagnosis, and service acceptabilitysource: https://lnkd.in/gy5ukAgDPlease like or share, if you choose to donate to my Movember page please visit https://lnkd.in/gaeCcen2Movember #Movember #menshealthmonth #help #donate #depressionawareness #sucideprevention #men #fyp #mental #health #sad #need #save #savelives #matter #light #healthmotivation #November #2022year #depression #work

#motherhood - filled with contradictions‼️🤔 …It causes us constant #guilt while bringing us #infinite #joy It is filled with #uncertainty and #fear while also showing us a #strength and #courage that we didn’t know existed.  #kids will push our buttons and test our #patience more than anyone else, but we would walk through #fire for them without a moment’s hesitation.We feel overwhelmed and crave time to ourselves, but we feel #sad and like a part of us is missing when they aren’t around.It is the #hardest thing we'll ever do, but loving our kids is the #easiest thing we'll ever do.Motherhood is filled with #contradictions ‼️We grieve the prior versions of our kids, but also #love and #cherish who our kids are in the #present It is the greatest #responsibility of our lives, while also being the greatest #privilege We #teach and #guide our kids, but our kids are our #greatest #teachers of all.It robs us of our #identity while molding us into a better #version of ourselves.It is filled with messiness, chaos, and unpredictability, as well as tenderness, love, and #beauty Motherhood is filled with contradictions ‼️It will bring us our #highest highs and our #lowest lows.Motherhood is filled with contradictions ‼️True⁉️———————-.*I know dad's can feel much of this too.❤️🖋️Author: Randi Latzmanhttps://lnkd.in/eJr_PjjdThe author has this poem for sale on etsy at https://lnkd.in/e46nng38Artist: Margarita Sikorskaia

Seasonal Affective Disorder, or SAD, is a form of depression that comes and goes with the season and the amount of – or lack of – sunlight we are exposed to. It affects up to 3% of the population, or 10 million people, in the US alone.

Thermoelectric materials are a class of materials that convert heat into electricity. Thermoelectric generators are already being used by NASA for different exploration missions. However, lead and tellurium based thermoelectric materials provide the highest conversion efficiency, they are extremely toxic to the environment. While thermoelectric effect refers to the direct voltage generation from temperature differences across the electric junction formed by two dissimilar conductors (thermocouple), researchers have reported a new copper based biphasic material that intrinsically consists of two phases in the same material and is relatively easy to synthesize, scalable and non-toxic.They produced the material by ball milling a powdered mixture of copper, manganese, germanium and sulfur to form Cu₂₊ₓMn₁₋ₓGeS₄ that exhibited interconnected enargite-type and stannite-type nanodomains. Using a combination of experimental and ab-initio electron and phonon calculation researchers have studied the structure-property relationships to explain the role of two crystal structures and their interfaces and underlying mechanisms of electronic and thermal transport in the material. Interestingly, they found that when Mn²⁺ is replaced with Cu⁺, it demonstrated a remarkable enhancement in the power factor and figure of merit (ZT) owing to the formation of complex microstructures with interconnected nanodomains, defects, and coherent interfaces, that affected the material's electronic and thermal transport properties. To understand the material's complex crystal structure and nanostructure, researchers utilized a set of experimental techniques including X-ray diffraction, high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) and precession electron diffraction tomography that revealed interconnected enargite-type and stannite-type crystal structures via the formation of nanodomains with a high density of coherent interfaces. Phase-contrast imaging, HAADF-STEM, selected area diffraction and EDX measurements were performed on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Talos F200S S/TEM operated at 200 keV and precession electron diffraction tomography (PEDT) measurements were performed on a JEOL F200 S/TEM operated at 200 keV and equipped with a CFEG electron source and an Amsterdam Scientific Instruments CheeTah M3 hybrid-pixel single-electron counting direct electron detector to record PEDT datasets.

October and November were always difficult months for me. Something with the change in weather and time made me feel out of sorts. When I left my home in San Diego and moved to play basketball at Washington State University, I had no idea what Seasonal Affective Disorder was. (SAD has been linked to a biochemical imbalance in the brain prompted by shorter daylight hours and less sunlight in winter.) I went from days in the sun and on the beach to long winters where I spent my time either in class or the gym. I didn’t anticipate the effect that would have on my mental health. I also didn’t take into consideration my family history of mood disorders.  According to recent studies, in most cases, SAD begins in young adulthood and is more common in people with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. So, when I experienced my first bout with depression, I had no idea what was going on. I didn’t know why I couldn’t get out of bed. I found myself crying for no reason. I felt ashamed and embarrassed. The added pressure of living up to expectations on the basketball court and in the classroom made me feel like a failure. What I didn’t know back then was I was not alone and there were things I could have done. There wasn’t much information back then and doctors were not able to put the pieces together to help me. Now, there is so much more information available to help us better understand SAD and how to alleviate its effects.  A few signs and symptoms of SAD-Feeling sad or having a depressed mood.-Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed.-Changes in appetite; usually eating more, craving carbohydrates.-Change in sleep; usually sleeping too much.-Feeling worthless or guilty.-Difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making decisions.-Thoughts of death or suicide.Ways to combat SAD!-Maintain a regular bedtime (Easier said than done in college, I know)-Expose yourself to as much bright light as you can. Walk outdoors on sunny days, even during the winter months. If it is gray and overcast, use as much light indoors as you can.Increase the amount of light in your home, apartment, or room. Position furniture so the windows are not blocked; open the blinds and/or curtains.Light therapy is also a great tool. There are many different types of Vitamin D lamps out there. I wouldn’t suggest it, but our team doctor prescribed visiting a tanning booth twice a week.-Stay physically active and begin your physical activity before the winter blues begin to set in. Physical exercise helps relieve stress and anxiety which can accentuate SAD. If you are feeling down, or not like yourself, please reach out to someone – a doctor, loved one, trusted confidant. There are ways to help what you are experiencing.  #mentalhealth #mentalhealthmatters #sad #seasonalaffectivedisorder #tuesday

Pay attention to the following signs of a quietly desperate life.  You might be leading one if:1. You’ve worked hard to reach a place of comfort and security — but you’re still dissatisfied.  You’re comfortable, but you feel trapped.  Every path away seems to go downhill.2. You’ve convinced yourself you’re not talented, creative, disciplined, or lucky enough to pursue your dreams.  You think you’re not one of the chosen few, so you’ve resigned yourself to mediocrity.3. You’ve accepted the power your fears hold over you, and you work within their constraints.  You concede to your fears rather than confronting them.  You refuse to do anything scary and new.  4. You’re your own worst naysayer.  You focus on how your plans will fail rather than on how to make them work.  You expend great energy rationalizing inaction.  You’ve decided your past failures predict future ones.  5. You’ve adopted a fatalistic attitude.  Rather than working to improve your situation, you sit idly, hoping to get a lucky break.  Rather than working to help yourself, you wait for others to help you.6. You’ve decided you missed your chance.  You’re too old, too committed, or too set in your ways to turn back now.  Instead you sit and watch younger and more-free people do what you want to do.source: https://lnkd.in/gmpAHyS7.

Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a transitory type of depression that affects millions of people every year. 🌨 Research suggests that the condition is triggered by a lack of sunlight during the autumnal and winter months and can not only lower serotonin levels, but also increase melatonin production; making sufferers feel especially tired all day. One completely natural treatment for SAD is light therapy, where patients sit in front of special UV lightboxes for a half-an-hour first thing in the morning from fall until the beginning of spring. ☀ Learn more about how to use light therapy and other naturopathic treatments for SAD at the link.#sad #depression #seasonalaffectivedisorder #mentalhealth #naturalmedicine

#life #happy #sadIf you're worried about what others think, then you're putting yourself at a disadvantage.The thing is, people will always have an opinion and it might not always be good. And if you spend too much time worrying about what they think, you're likely to miss important opportunities.So don't spend time and effort caring too much about what other people think.

As someone who (tries to) cope with SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder), I wanted to wish everyone *Good Luck* the run up to the darker nights.2 pieces of paper that help me are, permanently, on my monitor - "If you never say no, how valuable is your yes" and a diagram of steps starting with "I won't do it" and finishing with "Yes I did it". Some days you get to the "I did it stage" and some days you're still at the "I want to do it stage".We've all done this before, we can do it again. Just a reminder to be gentle with yourself and others during this time - some days are like walking through treacle!

I am beyond incredibly sad to hear we just lost one of my absolute favorites and a legend to many around the world, Mr. Jason David Frank, known all over the world as Tommy Oliver, the Green Ranger/White Ranger from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Due to his popularity Tommy Oliver would go on to be the longest running character appearing in many different versions of the Power Rangers. Jason David Frank was not only a great actor but an accomplished martial artists & MMA fighter with an undeafeated record. This man is one of the reasons I got into martial arts as a child & anyone who knows me knows that to this day I still have the Green Ranger Flute song as my ring tone! I am beyond crushed right now...I was however, fortunate enough to meet JDF once and he was kind, generous, and just a  wonderful person. Thank you Jason David Frank..Thank you so much for giving us so many amazing performances over the years. Thank you for all your hard work over the years. Gone but NEVER forgotten! RIP Jason David Frank. If you are having thoughts of harming yourself or others, call 988 to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.#film #jdf #legend #jasondavidfrank #dustinardine #loss #tragedy #losangeles #rip #socialmediainfluencer #powerrangers #hollywoodmovies #actorpage #ripjasondavidfrank #thankyou #sad #mmpr #picoftheday #hollywood #celebrities #martialarts #mightymorphinpowerrangers #greenranger #suicideprevention #actorslife #whiteranger #restinpeace #tommyoliver #gonebutneverforgotten

Love is a powerful emotion, and it can be healing. While love can’t fix everything or prevent someone from developing a mental illness, it does support good overall physical and mental health.The research clearly shows that loving and healthy relationships, as well as good social support from family and friends, are important for improving mental health.If you have a spouse, partner or friend and either one of you struggles with mental health issues, take comfort knowing that you support each other.source: https://lnkd.in/g9a-K7wBPlease like or share, if you choose to donate to my Movember page please visit https://lnkd.in/gaeCcen2Movember #Movember #menshealthmonth #help #donate #depressionawareness #sucideprevention #men #fyp #mental #health #sad #need #save #savelives #matter #light #healthmotivation #November #2022year #depression #work

One in four of us will experience mental health difficulties in our lives. Yet, research from the mental health charity Time to Change found that over three-quarters of us (78%) would tell friends and family we’re fine, even if we were struggling with a mental health problem. So, let’s say that you sense something’s up with a friend or a loved one. Maybe they’ve become more withdrawn and are drinking more than they usually do. Or maybe something just seems off. How do you check in on them? How do you sweep aside these pre-programmed responses and find out what’s really going on?Here are just a few tips to help you start the conversation….Look for signs of distressTime it rightMake sure you’re readyAsk twiceListen carefullySpeak with care Offer helpShare your story Remind them how much you caresource: https://lnkd.in/dfDJ2sKcPlease like or share, if you choose to donate to my Movember page please visit https://lnkd.in/gaeCcen2Movember #Movember #menshealthmonth #help #donate #depressionawareness #sucideprevention #men #fyp #mental #health #sad #need #save #savelives #matter #light #healthmotivation #November #2022year #depression #work

November is a difficult month...the days are short, the sky is gray, and we can feel like we just want to stay in bed all day (I just realized that rhymed!)I love my morning workout and start hydrating right away to feel my best. The cold shower is a great boost (even 30 seconds can help if you haven't had cold showers before).

5 Things You Should Know About Depression1. Not everyone who is depressed cries or has tearful outbursts. When people hear the word “depression,” the first image that comes to mind is somebody crying and continuously feeling sad. This can be true, but it is not always the case. Research shows that sadness and tearfulness are not necessarily obvious symptoms, especially for men. Many people suffer silently, not expressing their emotions. Others become angry as an outlet for their depression. The way that depression manifests takes many forms.2. Trying to be positive does not cure depression. If you suffer from depression, or you know someone who does, you may have heard people saying how critical it is to keep a positive attitude, look on the bright side of life, or be grateful for what you have. While these statements are technically true for all of us, they can be incredibly frustrating for somebody who is suffering. Having depression is not like flipping a switch.3. Depression can lead to physical pain and illness. Depression not only affects our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, but it also affects our bodies. People with depression can and often do experience chronic physical symptoms such as stomach aches, headaches, bodily aches and pains, and fatigue. In some cases, chronic depression is related to worse outcomes in physical conditions such as heart disease, gastrointestinal conditions, and a compromised immune system.4. Unless you’ve experienced depression yourself, you won’t fully understand its impact. This idea can be very frustrating for those who love and support someone who is depressed. But clinical depression is not the same experience as feeling down, having a bad week or having a negative attitude about life. It’s a mental health condition that can be serious and chronic and affect the person mentally and physically. Mental health treatment is essential for treating depression, rather than merely exercising, eating healthier, or thinking positive thoughts.5. Depression can be successfully treated but won’t be “cured.”To find out more about depression read the entire article "5 Things You Should Know About Depression"written by Carla Shuman Ph.D. https://lnkd.in/eGpe4DsH (IG @mindfulsolutionsllc) which can be found on the Psychology Today website:https://lnkd.in/gTYYwn32If you struggle with depression call LighthouseTherapy for a free 15 minute consultationwith Tabitha Stanton at 833-749-3549 Ext 700.Video by Darina Belonogova (IG @darinbelonogova): https://lnkd.in/gZUTyZdh#mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #depression #sad #mentalillness #mentalhealthmatters #selfcare #ptsd #selflove #therapy #life #depressed #healing #recovery #stress #motivation #trauma #bipolar #sadness #mindfulness #psychology #wellness #pain #depressionhelp #broken#depressionawareness #hope

Kindness also gets you out of your own head. When you're depressed or unhappy, you tend to dwell on your own problems. That's not to say these feelings aren't valid, just that they're too much in the foreground. Helping someone else makes you consider things from their perspective and interrupts your rumination.Please like or share, if you choose to donate to my Movember page please visit https://lnkd.in/gaeCcen2Movember #Movember #menshealthmonth #help #donate #depressionawareness #sucideprevention #men #fyp #mental #health #sad #need #save #savelives #matter #light #healthmotivation #November #2022year #depression #work

I’m breaking my rule, just this once, as I wait to deal with a sick #kiddo! Part of my journey was the point 8 years ago When I decided I didn’t have to live sick, Manipulate, use people and most of all Quit using booze and chemicals. #sober I had about 100lbs to loose And #teeth that had been neglected my whole life. And my enamel was gone because the #trauma I’ve lived through has made it so I puke when nervous. (Yes parents, take your kids to the dentist) We knew when I addressed it we were looking at 30k easy, which it was. We barley make it with my #sidehustles! So as a #jobseeker a huge motivation Was to get my teeth fixed finally, I’m a cool 6 ft2 and 210 now, so most the weight is gone! Well, this summer as I realized how Bad the #jobmarket had become, #toxic #linkedin can beWe started saving, My wife took out new insurance, And as of #friday, I can smile again with confidence, They handed me a mirror and I heave cried out of no whereHence the post, Something I saw as so far in the distance it was unobtainable, Was right in front of me when I started asking the right questions Instead of Manipulation, lying and burying who I was playing in real lifein booze and chemicals, I hope I never crossed to the passive a hole land of #linkedin. And neglecting my true purpose which is being of service to Those in need, thoose next to me! First my #family, I’m sure glad we never got to a place where I spent so much time with strangers my wife had to send me a note, How #sad.

Last weekend we “fell back” in time and now the sun sets as early as 5pm… are you someone who suffers from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)? This is the time when life can be more difficult for people suffering from SAD.We sometimes joke about hibernating in the winter, holiday weight, and not wanting to leave the house, but the truth is that you could be suffering from SAD. Don't hesitate to reach out and discuss behavioral changes that seem to be associated with weather changes. You don't HAVE to suffer through it, you can embrace a treatment plan for it!https://lnkd.in/g9S2EZhwdonna@lifebydesigncounselinggroup.com214-960-3632#seasonalaffectivedisorder #SAD #seasonaldepression #todayidontwanttodoanything #ijustwanttolayinmybed #winterblues #depressionsupport #lifebydesigncounselinggroup

Being an advocate means speaking up for / supporting what you believe in. A mental health advocate in my eyes means showing support and solidarity with those suffering and to always work and act in a way that aligns with this. It means posting about the highlights but also the challenges. It is about being real and authentic not only for myself, but for my audience as well.Social media, events and everyday interactions are where a believer becomes an advocate. That’s why we are here 🫶🏽•••••••••#Mentalhealth #mentalhealthpage #mentalhealthempowerment #mentalhealthblogger #mentalhealthpositivity #positivevibes #positive #positivemindset #mentalhealthawareness #selfcare #selflove #depression #depressionawareness #anxiety #anxietyawareness #mentalhealthquotes #quotes #quoteoftheday #happy #happiness #sad #mentalhealthsupport #depressionsupport #anxietysupport #mentalhealththerapy #mentalhealthprevention #goodvibes #happyvibes #positivementalhealth #yanaclub

Do you agree that our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors are all linked?. Technically, our thoughts impact how we feel and act. Although Negative thinking is something we all engage in from time to time, but constant negativity can destroy your mental health, leaving you depressed and anxious. it is important to know what to do when they appear, so we don’t let them change the course of our day,As you observe your thoughts, work on identifying and labeling cognitive distortions and negativity.For example, if you tend to view yourself as a complete success or failure in every situation, then you are engaging in "black-and-white" thinking. Other negative thinking patterns include:Jumping to conclusions: This distortion involves making assumptions about what others are thinking or making negative assumptions about how events will turn out.Catastrophizing: This pattern of negative thinking is characterized by always assuming that the worst possible outcome will happen without considering more likely and realistic possibilities.Overgeneralization: This pattern is marked by a tendency to apply what happened in one experience to all future experiences. This can make negative experiences seem unavoidable and contribute to feelings of anxiety."Should" statements: Thinking marked by "should" statements contribute to a negative perspective by only thinking in terms of what you "ought" to be doing. Such statements are often unrealistic and cause people to feel defeated and pessimistic about their ability to succeed.Unhelpful thinking patterns differ in subtle ways. But they all involve distortions of reality and irrational ways of looking at situations and people.A more structured way to deal with negative thoughts is to examine the credible evidence for and against them. Next, replace the negative thought with a more positive one.

This is when someone in your environment (typically family, friends or work colleagues) feels a certain type of way and with a little bit of time around them you feel that way also.You DO NOT want to be emotionally entangled with others emotions. You want to keep your emotions and there emotions separate, unless you're being empathetic to them in a difficult time.Make sure to pay attention to..1. How much sympathy and empathy you have for others. You can get lost in their life, their stories, their emotions..2. Establish your boundaries. If someone brings negative energy, and life draining emotions to you.. establish that you are not going to be their emotional discharge and do not join the pity party with them. This can create a state where they are self victimized further and lead to them continuing this behavior.3. Emotional entanglement requires a lack of emotional awareness to relate distinction between your emotions and their emotions.Focus on creating more emotional awareness within yourself and leveling your emotional intelligence so that you are not easily manipulated into feeling bad simply because someone else is.Just Because someone is feeling a certain type of energy such as bitterness, anger, jealousy or envy doesn't mean that we need to also.It is important to have empathy for people that are going through difficult times, but it's also important to recognize when people are using their emotions against you to get them to join their pity party.The last thing you want to do is to enable the victimhood mentality and keep your friends and family in a negative state while thinking you're helping.#pityparty #emotionalintelligence#emotionalentanglement #emotionalregulation #emotions #emotion #anger #bitterness #greed #envy #jealousy #sad #gossipgirl #negativeenergy #mentality #mentalhealth #fyp #wellbeing #wellnesscoach #wellness #lifestyle #healthymind #fyp

Feeling down but not sure why? How much do you know about Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)? This is a type of depression that comes and goes in a seasonal pattern. It can also be known as ‘winter depression’ because it’s commonly associated with the colder months when we get less sunlight, and therefore less Vitamin D. Signs to look out for:⚫A persistent low mood⚫Loss of interest in normal activities⚫Feelings of despair, guilt and worthlessness⚫Sleeping for longer and finding it hard to get up in the morning⚫Decreased sex drive⚫Weight gain and craving carbohydratesIf you feel you may be suffering from SAD, as well as consulting a therapist who can guide you towards the most effective treatment, exposing yourself to as much natural light as possible, practicing mindfulness and getting plenty of exercise can help to get you back on track.#SeasonalAffectiveDisorder #SAD #mind #therapy #counselling #mentalhealth #mentalhealthsupport #mentalhealthawareness #counseling #Chelsea #London #HarleyStreet #MentalHealthMatters #winter #therapist #psychology #psychologist

1 in 10 people aged 12 and up are on an antidepressant. Antidepressants cause emotional blunting, an INABILITY to FEEL emotions. People have reported not being able to CRY, LAUGH, or feel JOY. Emotional expression is an integral part of wellbeing.In traditional medicine it's believed that STORED EMOTIONS are linked to disease states. Blocked energetic pathways can develop from physical injuries or repressed/stored emotional charges. KIDS are being medicated and numbed. Adults are living joyless lives and their kids are witnessing this existence. Along with emotional blunting, some people can't even feel EMPATHY. They literally cannot care about another human's wellbeing to the extent that we are designed to do so. My questions have always been:If it's a chemical imbalance, is the doctor testing for which chemical it is?If not, how do they know which chemical to prescribe?And how do they know the correct dose?Symptom mitigation isn't healing.There is a better way. True health is possible.#chronicillness #antidepressants #depressionawareness #anxiety #holistichealth #statistics #symptommanagement #healthy #joy #sad #dontsettle #mindset #coaching #painrelief #chronicpain #healing #reprogram #wellbeing #people #medicine #chemical #empathy #health #testing

As the weather gets chillier and the seasons change, we want to talk about a very important topic...Our goal at Aware is to raise awareness and improve the mental health statistics in children and adolescents. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a form of depression that typically occurs during the fall and winter months when there is less natural sunlight. Symptoms of SAD can include low energy, difficulty consulting and memory, increased irritability, social withdrawal, and behavioral problems. If your child is experiencing any of these symptoms, it is important to talk to a mental health professional.Learn more about how we're raising awareness and giving back: awarenyc.com/giving-back...#aware #becomeaware #mentalhealth #adolescents #children #seasonalaffectivedisorder #SAD #seasonalchanges #socialwithdrawl #symptoms #raiseawareness #panda

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that occurs with the changing of the seasons, which can affect up to 10 percent of people in the United States, depending on where they live. 

It’s time to become educated on taking care of ourselves. This last quarter of 2022, I decree and declare the joy of the Lord to consume you from the inside out, in Jesus name.

5 ways to convert your self-criticism into self-acknowledgmentIf you're like most people, you're probably your own worst critic. You beat yourself up for every little mistake. While it's good to be self-critical to a certain extent, it's essential to know when to draw the line. Otherwise, you'll end up feeling bad about yourself all the time.Here are five ways to convert your self-criticism into self-acknowledgment:1. Monitor Your Inner VoiceThe first step is to become aware of your inner voice. Pay attention to the things you say to yourself daily. Are they mostly negative? If so, it's time to start monitoring your inner voice and try to silence (or at least stop listening to) your inner critic.2. Set Realistic ExpectationsOne of the main reasons why we're so hard on ourselves is because we set unrealistic expectations. We expect to be perfect always, and when we're not, we feel like we've failed.Instead of setting unrealistic expectations, try to be more realistic. Accept that you're not going to be perfect and that it's okay to make mistakes. When you make a mistake, acknowledge it and learn from it.3. Find the HelpersInspired by the famous Mr. Rogers quote: "When I was a boy, and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, 'Look for the helpers." You will always find people who are helping.'Whenever you're feeling down about yourself, try to find "the helpers." Look for the positive things in your life and the people who are always there for you. Focusing on the positive will help you see the good in yourself.4. Accept complimentsOne of the best ways to silence your inner critic is to accept compliments. Don't brush it off or downplay it whenever someone pays you a compliment. Just say "thank you" and believe the person is telling the truth.5. Practice self-compassionFinally, try to be more compassionate with yourself. If you make a mistake, don't beat yourself up. Instead, try to understand why you made a mistake and how you can avoid making it in the future.If you can start following these tips, you'll slowly but surely begin to silence your inner critic. You'll start to feel better about yourself, and you'll be able to focus on and enjoy the positive things in your life. ....for more visit :https://bit.ly/3sFOEoR #anxiety #depression #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #selfcare #love #mentalhealthmatters #stress #selflove #ptsd #mentalillness #therapy #healing #health #wellness #mindfulness #anxietyrelief #motivation #recovery #trauma #life #psychology #sad #bipolar #meditation #anxietyawareness #quotes #covid #pain #loveyourself

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that occurs with the changing of the seasons, which can affect up to 10 percent of people in the United States, depending on where they live. 

It’s time to become educated on taking care of ourselves. This last quarter of 2022, I decree and declare the joy of the Lord to consume you from the inside out, in Jesus name.

The other day my therapist asked me how I felt. Words came to me but my lips refused to move. A lingering taste of bitter tears tainted my throat.After a moment of silence, she advised me to use colors to express my feelings."I feel blue, with a hint of lavender but sometimes I feel yellow with a tinge of emerald green. I feel pink, red and at times, I just feel black and white. Not often do I feel golden, but when I do it's almost immediately replaced by a deep hue of blue."How is it that I felt a spectrum of rainbow within seconds? How is it that despite feeling rainbow, I feel empty at the same time? This conundrum can only be experienced, not explained.This is the beauty of being human; being able to feel and experience thousands of emotions! Yet, this is our biggest disadvantage. Letting our strong emotions take the driver's seat often leads to disasters. Sadness drives the car of depression, and runs over hope. Fear drives the train of anxiety and forgets to stop at the reality station. The good part? Help is always available!We here at generation yellow are always there for you, no matter what colour you feel like! :)[Artwork and caption by Tia Mehtani]#art #artwork #artist #teenagers #emotional  #positive #feelings #creative #teens #teenagers #well #help #happy #smile  #blue #abstract #abstractart #sunday #monday #reality #love #depression #sad #hope #anxiety #positivity

Damn 2022! Could you stop taking away our living legends please! I am beyond incredibly sad to hear the news about the passing of one of my absolutle favorite stand up comedians of all time, Mr. Leo Anthony Gallagher Jr, known all over the world as Gallagher! Typically putting on anywhere from 100-200 shows a year in a more than 40+ year career, along with his trusty sledgeomati. Gallagher was one of the most recognizable comediac performers of the 80's and 90's and was included in a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time! Thank you so much for giving us so many amazing performances over the years. Thank you for all your hard work over the years. Gone but NEVER forgotten!

Anxiety most often travels in the company of its henchmen—stress and depression. In fact, anxiety and depression are likely different expressions of a shared underlying biology. As many as two-thirds of people with anxiety disorders also suffer from depression at some point in their lives, and over half of people with depression also have an anxiety disorder.  HOW DOES IT AFFECT YOUR HEART?There is a  relationship between heart health and depression. There is mounting evidence for an independent anxiety–heart disease link as well. In particular, people who have generalized anxiety disorder seem to suffer higher rates of heart attacks and other cardiac events. The effect is more pronounced in people who already have a diagnosis of heart disease, and the risk rises with the intensity and frequency of anxiety symptoms. CAN ANXIETY BE TREATED? Anxiety disorders are very treatable. Most patients who suffer from anxiety can reduce or eliminate symptoms after several (or fewer) months of psychotherapy, and many patients notice improvement after just a few sessions.Talk to your doctor today, you're not alone....#anxiety #depression #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #selfcare #love #mentalhealthmatters #stress #selflove #ptsd #mentalillness #therapy #healing #health #wellness #mindfulness #anxietyrelief #motivation #recovery #trauma #life #psychology #sad #bipolar

Blueprint #3: Reduce your #anxiety significantly with these #supplement stacksYour 3 #actionablesAssess if you're diet is lacking in #magnesium (it probably is). If so, take 200–350 mg of magnesium in the form of citrate, gluconate, or diglycinate, every day before bed time. If your anxiety is due to magnesium deficiency, you will feel a difference in 2 weeksAfter trying magnesium, if you still have anxiety, figure out what kind of anxiety you have. Is it due to stress? Is it generalized anxiety disorder (#GAD)? Is it social anxiety disorder (#SAD)? For the ladies, is it related premenstrual syndrome (PMS)? Once you figure that out, check out the following protocolsTry the protocols/stacks below but make sure to consult your doctor and do your own research on them first. When you try them, try them one at a time for a couple of weeks to see what effect they have before adding or switching to another one. Natural supplements may or may not work, but the ones mentioned below have the best evidence that I could findIf you have GAD:Add #lavender (should have 25 – 46% linalool) starting with 80 mg of Silexan per day; you can increase it to 160 mg/day after a week if it doesn't work; effects may take 6–10 weeks to feel or Add #kava (should have 70 mg of kavalactones, three times a day) for 4 weeks; NOTE: there are concerns about liver damage with kava, so if you have liver issues or take drugs that are metabolized in the liver, it may be best to avoid kavaIf you have panic attacks:Add #inositol (14–18 g) dailyAdd #agmatine at 1.62 mg/kg (so 110 mg for a 150 lb person; 150 mg for a 200 lb person; 180 mg for a 250 lb person)If you have SAD or stress-related anxiety:Add #ashwagandha (300–500 mg of the root powder or 15–60 mg of withanolides) once daily; taking it in the evening may cause insomnia, so take it earlier in the dayAdd #rhodiola rosea (80–160 mg of the SHR-5 extract) once daily in the evenings; NOTE: avoid if you are taking a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), as it can cause the dreaded "serotonin syndrome"If you have PMS-related anxiety:Add #vitex agnus-castus (either 150–250 mg of the dried berry, 20 mg of the Ze 110 extract, or 4 mg of the BNO 1095 extract) once dailyIf you have general state or trait anxiety:Add 1.25 g of arginine and 1.25 g of lysine twice a day (i.e., 2.5 g of each per day), with or without a meal; effects may be felt after one weekFor a deeper dive into these stacks and the appropriate references, take a look at the full blueprint.
