On the International men's day I wish to take a moment to reflect.I believe that men should cry, and it's time for the society to normalize tears in their eyes. Crying does not make you any less of a man, it makes you human.  Life can throw us curveballs. Yet even when things seem tough, there’s a lot we can do to look after ourselves and others. So if you feel overwhelmed - talk to someone about it, a friend, a therapist, family member. If you don't have anyone like that - you can talk to me. The society tells boys being a man requires physical and sexual prowess, being loud and in charge, drinking black coffee, driving fast cars, and no crying. When in reality being a real man means having integrity, showing emotions, being empathetic, and caring for others. Young boys who don’t cry turn into men who don’t cry. And men who don’t cry are suppressing their feelings — and these suppressed feelings eventually have to come out - in the form of violence, or overdosing on alcohol and drugs, or shirking responsibilities, or becoming a workaholic.I cry when I hurt emotionally, mentally, and spiritually.Men, stop suppressing your emotions, and lean into them. Let yourself cry and watch the freedom that comes. Start sharing how you feel and let there be healing.Boys will not be boys.Boys will be kind and thoughtful.Boys will share their feelings and stand up for others that do.Boys will cry.Because boys who cry turn into men who cry. And that will be better for everyone.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), males die by suicide at twice the rate of females. And high-income countries have the highest suicide rates among males.Mental health professionals diagnose depression more often in women than in men, according to the nonprofit Mental Health America (MHA). At the same time, the organization adds, more than 6 million American men experience symptoms of depression annually — and most go undiagnosed.Don't wait. Ask for help. #suicideprevention #depression #donotbeashamedtocry #help #mentalhealth #health

Today my son's, Mikey 10 and Angelo 7, went with their Grandma to an orphanage along Kangundo Rd, Eastern part of Nairobi, an orphanage for disabled children and teens. They brought some clothes with them to give away.Next week we are going back with more resources and money and to spend time with the orphans, wash clothes, clean and other stuff we are assigned to do. A couple of years ago I visited Mathari Hospital, the only public, Gov institution, psychiatric hospital in Kenya.I was there to discuss capital injection and how the entire area could be rebuilt and invest in proper facilities for the patients and not only offer psychiatric care, but other disciplines as well.The current facility has capacity for 1500 patients, located near the slum area of Mathare district of Nairobi, along Thika Road.It was founded 1910, and basically nothing has been done over plus 110 years. It is like time has stood still. Walking around on the area takes a toll of your mindset. Leadership is not only a Corporate matter, it is as much about moral guidance and decency. I want my kids to know that, experience that and with their own eyes see, with their hands feel, with their ears listen, that life is much more than social media, career, big packages and chasing of success. Just look at how we treat Depression and suicides among us, we have family, working colleagues, young people etcetera, going into severe depression, some so far that they end their lives... and we shun it, it's uncomfortable, it's a stigma and a majority of the people don't want to hear about it, nor see it. Heads in the sand is much more comfortable.Building a society or a company is about humans, humans who are pushing and driving it forward. We must recognize that it is ok to be human, ok to say "I'm not ok", without being judged by a shallow environment. Leadership is all about moral, what defines you as a Leader, not your bank account, not your fancy toys, it's about what you show others where to go and what to do without personal benefits.Success is measured what you do for others to grow, communities to grow. You plant seeds for others to harvest. #leadership #depression #humanitarian

One day, I was 30 with an infant in my lap.. A man by my side..Just like that!Then came a day, I was 31 with a toddler in my lap..And no life partner for support!I looked around for the people for whom the milestones were important.. They were no where to be seen..I tried to find the society to ask what should I do now?Turns out, it exists at only for setting up moral pathways and rules..I turned to family for support.. I realized that a married and separated (not divorced) women with a kid has 3 options:a) First and most important - Go back to your husbandb) Second (more practical one according to people) - Give your kid to him and live your life.c) Third (hardly prescribed) - Raise the kid yourselfI don't know how may women have gone through this, and how many continue to go through it..When I did, it was HELL !It gets overwhelming, not to mention the times one feels like just ending it all.. Especially when our loved ones get more concerned about what impact it has on their status and image in society, rather than our #mentalhealthThere are few things more stressful in life than going through a divorce. Not only is it a painful and emotional process, it’s also a logistical and expense-laden ordeal.We experience stress daily, and we have coping strategies to manage.. but divorce stress is outside the norm, with a level of intensity that requires deliberate coping mechanisms.Access to professional help is available, and yet it continues to be looked down upon.. as if asking for help for yourself is a sign of weakness..But is it, really??#piasingh #stress #depression #panic #anxiety

Happy to share my new commentary on the growing evidence for the opioid system in the etiology of depressive disorders! #neuroscience #depression #opioids
-----------------------------
Three years ago, at 47, I was diagnosed with #autism and #adhd . Finally, I understood why my professional and personal life had always been a struggle, even though I always had high grades at school and university. After my diagnosis, I felt sad and relieved at the same time. Sad, because none of the psychologists and psychiatrists I had consulted over the years, had found the cause of my #depression, agitation and restlessness and I had spent so much time not knowing. Moreover, my diagnosis was not a disease which could be ‘cured’. Relieved, because I could finally get suitable support for my depression and #anxiety, and started to discover my own ‘manual’. I have had a hard time to accept my diagnoses and to be accepted. Now after three (or 50?) years the dust has settled. I have learned my boundaries and how to keep them. I have learnt in which circumstances I can excel and flourish and I am able to express my needs. As well, I have discovered my strong traits which are related to ADHD and Autism (good memory, meticulous, analytical, focused, organised, structured, detailed, dedicated, loyal, reliable, honest, open, spontaneous, enthusiastic, quick, etc.)Today, I attended a performance by Dames die Raken!, a show about the difficulty to be open about psychological vulnerability at work and the actual power of #vulnerability. I was deeply touched and felt recognised. Research has shown that 43% of Dutch have psychological difficulties in life. Being open about this a still a taboo, there is always the fear of receiving a label or #stigma . One does not know how people will react, and whether they will be biased or judgmental. Still, I decided to open up about my predicament, because it does not help anyone to stay silent and to not talk about it.Thank you network for your understanding and for not being judgmental and biased. #neurodiversity #adhdwomen #autismspectrum #neurodiversityatwork #autismatwork #adhdadult #autisme #depressie #diversity #inclusion #diversityatwork #inclusionatwork #asd #burnout #hoogbegaafd #highlyintelligent Carla Kalhorn Dieuwke Tazelaar

Is the US economy in a recession and taking the world with it????? . . . . . The United States is facing rising recession fears as the Federal Reserve, the country's central bank, remains bullish in fighting high inflation. Officials are thinking the need to impose some economic pain to get price pressure under control. There's still good amount of strength in labour market and that's going to allow the fed to remain aggressive in fighting inflation.  #economy #inflazione #depression #us

Even as moderator, I was riveted by this panel of atai Life Sciences & COMPASSPathways founders/#leaders.

I've suffered from sleep problems and residual effects such as depression and lethargy. I recently decided to do a bit of research on the topic and discovered some interesting evidence linking sleep patterns to depression.The prevalence of sleeping disorders is startling. It's estimated that approximately 15% of people living in industrialised countries suffer from some form of chronic sleep problem. The 3 most common complaints are:😴 trouble staying awake (hypersomnia)😳 trouble sleeping (insomnia)😵 abnormal sensations or behavior during sleep (parasomnias)Since the 1960s polysomnographic sleep research has demonstrated that depression is associated with altered sleep architecture. There are five phases of sleep: stages 1, 2, 3, 4 and REM (rapid eye movement), see image below. Your brain, heart, and metabolism act differently at certain stages of sleep. This presents an interesting opportunity to identify underlying sleep contributors to depression using a range of wearable biosensors to address mental well-being in the general population.I'm fascinated by the prospect and have begun looking into this problem area further at Antler. If you're familiar with any expert, enthusiast, or researcher with an interest in this area, I am keen to have a chat with them.🙂  #sleep #depression #mentalhealth #sleeptech #wearables

It is not un-manly to talk about your mental health. Men: keep talking, it might just save yours or someone else’s life. Thank you Ian McCann for sharing your story. #internationalmensday2022 #mentalhealth #wellbeing #depression #suicideprevention

•Feelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness•Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters•Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities•Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much.•Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort•Reduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain•Anxiety, agitation or restlessnessSlowed thinking, speaking or body movements•Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame._______________________If you constantly find yourself stuck between any of these symptoms, you're gradually going into a stage known as DEPRESSION. Depression is a mood change that causes a persistent feeling of sadness, overwhelming and loss of interest in anything you find interesting before. Also called a major depressive disorder, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. In this phase, you may find yourself having trouble doing normal day-to-day activities and sometimes may feel as if life isn't worth living.Sometimes, you cry too much. Nothing seems worthy anymore. You feel downcast and just want everything to end immediately. #depression #mentalhealth #selfawareness

One of the most significant traits of life is being and feeling alive. Not being sick or being healthy, but simply feeling alive. I attached a short video with one of my children, because they have no problems with appying this philosophy;)But most people won't achieve it, because it only sounds good in theory. They prefer to strive for comfort and happiness instead,therefore rarely switch into this mode. And there is a connection with longevity.There is a funny trend in TikTok videos showing that so many young guys prefer to play video games instead of having sex with their partners. Does it mean that video games are better? In the era of political correctness where people are taught to be nice and positive to each other these guys cannot expresses in bed anything connected with testosterone, so they naturally choose videogames, where this hormone can be expressed without limits. So they feel great. They feel alive on this level. So you want to be nice and positive all the time? Sure, but forget about feeling alive. And forget about being truly healthy.You jump into cold water and suddenly feel more alive than ever. If you criticize someone or you are criticized, if you fight someone, risk something, try something new that pulls you out of this regular lazy mode...Many of these things may be healthy and rejuventing for you, but their seemingly negative nature don't push people into that "stuff".Today I read very a interesting article from Cody Shirk  and indeed mental health and longevity are strongly connected. But how difficult it is to achieve when we are blocked in so many ways. And healthy diet won't help us here. Because health is not always about "good" and "correct". #mentalhealth #happiness #videogames #longevity #aging #alive #life #depression

Last month on Thriving in Diversity myself  Steven Dayan Doris Day, MD  Dr Evan Rieder and Dr. Katherine Phillips tackled the pervasive Body Dysmorphia Disorder (BDD). 🪞We discussed a study that were retrospectively reviewed for psychiatric conditions in the Dermatology setting.There were 1,000 patients from a cosmetic dermatology clinic and 1,000 patients from a medical dermatology clinic, both at MGH. The researchers found that 49% of patients in the cosmetic group had been diagnosed with at least one psychiatric disorder, compared with 33% in the medical group (P < .00001).The most most common psychiatric disorders were anxiety, depression, ADHD, and insomnia. 🧠39% of patients in the cosmetic group had 2 or more psychiatric disorders, compared with 22 of those in the medical group.44% of patients in the cosmetic group were on a psychiatric medications, compared with 28% in the medical group (P < .00001).   It’s important to note that studies have found the incident of patients with BDD in the Dermatology setting to be as high as 13%. These studies are an important  into further elucidating our cosmetic patient population's motivations for care and effectively guiding our patients through consultation and treatment to ensure realistic expectations. 🙏Go to https://lnkd.in/gkHrNHg5 to catch the last episode of thriving in case you missed it and as always let me know what you think below. ✨#anxiety #depression #adhd #insomnia #bodydysmorphiadisorder #lovetheskinyouarein #bdd #mentalhealthawareness #aestheticdermatology

Vilken behandling bör min medarbetare få för sitt utmattningssyndrom?Enligt Socialstyrelsen bör behandlingen baseras på psykologiskt stöd för att skapa balans mellan aktivitet och #vila, för att undvika återinsjuknande. Behandlingen bör också inriktas på att understödja #sömn och minska #oro. Sömnstörning är vanligt och regelbundna vanor och fysisk aktivitet spelar en avgörande roll både för symtomförbättring och för arbetsåtergång. Det är vanligt med samsjuklighet vid #utmattningssyndrom. Om medarbetaren har ångestproblem eller #depression  bör #samtalsbehandling erbjudas även för dessa problem. Avstämningsmöte med arbetsgivaren, medarbetaren, läkare, terapeut( eller annan vårdpersonal) och Försäkringskassan är mycket värdefullt. Det ökar chanserna till en lyckad återgång i arbetet. Här diskuteras medarbetarens aktuella #arbetsförmåga och möjligheter till anpassning på arbetsplatsen. En plan för återgång i arbetet upprättas. Arbetsåtergång sker successivt med arbetsuppgifter som är anpassade till medarbetarens kognitiva och fysiska förmåga.  Vid hel #sjukskrivning är det vanligt att man vid arbetsåtergång börjar med 25 procent arbete innan ytterligare upptrappning sker i lugn takt.Vänliga hälsningar Lars NordelvKBT-och parterapeutHälsorådgivare

Freund:innen können Betroffene unterstützen und so einen wichtigen Beitrag dafür leisten, dass es den Erkrankten wieder besser geht. Psychologie-Studierende der Universität Fribourg haben im folgenden Video mehrere nützliche Ratschläge zusammengestellt:0. Die Depression erkennen: Häufige Symptome sind Traurigkeit, frühere Lieblingsaktivitäten machen keine Freude mehr, Gefühl von Wertlosigkeit, sozialer Rückzug,...1. Depression als Krankheit verstehen, für die die Betroffenen nichts können.2. Die Gefühle validieren: es ist ok, traurig zu sein. Es werden auch wieder bessere Zeiten kommen.3. Den Teufelskreis des Rückzugs durchbrechen: es ist wichtig, positive Aktivitäten (wie die Lieblingsserie wieder gemeinsam zu schauen) in den Alltag einzubinden, auch wenn diese anfangs keinen Spass machen.4. Anstrengungen der betroffenen Person gegen die Depression anerkennen und sie dabei unterstützen.5. Ggf. die Hilfe von Fachpersonen (z.B. Psycholog:innen) anfordern.

This is a really inspiring documentary. Aside from the fact I’m a Forest fan this is an important message about depression and mental health. To the outsider you imagine Jesse lives the lavish lifestyle with a big income and millions of followers on social media. All of that counts for nothing if you suffer from depression. In this programme Jesse opens up about his Mum’s troubles and his own battle with depression. Mental health affects everyone and when you are under the media spotlight it can be even more of a struggle. This a worth watching https://lnkd.in/esydc8SX#depression #mensmentalhealth #mentalhealth #socialmedia #movember2022 #nffc #jesselingard #untoldstories #documentary

It was #internationalmensday yesterday Here's an important message on how to spot depression in men.Men are typically less likely to talk about and seek treatment for depression than women, many men may have undiagnosed depression.@rizzygoodman has been on a journey to explore the emotional, behavioral, and physical signs of depression in men.Pay attention to your friends, brother, nephew, dad. It cost nothing to check in. #MensHealth #Movember #Mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #menshealthmonth #depression #suicideprevention @samaritanscharityReposted from @goodmanfactory

This was a post uploaded on 19/11/22 but did not show. Today is International Men’s Day, so this is timely. Life is good when you have your health. The popular saying health is wealth is true. Your body is one of the complex machines that exist in the world. There are various parts each responsible for various actions. Each of these parts keep functioning for the number of years that you live except health challenges arises for that part of the body. You will appreciate any part of your body eg your little pinkie finger after any pain in it.Ensuring that parts of our body are functioning well is critical. We often forget to care for parts of our bodies that are hidden. Sometimes, it is when there is a problem we begin to take necessary caution of caring for these body parts.The other day I experienced an excruciating pain in the lower parts of my back. I tell you to walk was a serious problem. The pain was uncomfortable. After driving and coming out of the car was a serious problem. You know what; after the pain went away I now appreciate the ability to walk without any pain and thank God for the ease of walking.Attending information sessions on our health is crucial for our longevity and pain free life. Often, we prioritise other types of information over our health. If it is how to make money or any other topic we value more we rather attend that one than the one that would talk about our health. You have not realised that you can only make money when your body is healthy.My prayer for you and myself is that we would pay more attention to seeking information on how to live a healthy life daily and even if we have to pay a premium for it we would do just that. Remember that as you grow in age your body is reducing in its effectiveness and efficiency.  Health is truly wealth when your body is in one piece. Therefore, the second session of the African Men’s Health talk event is coming up on the 26th of November focusing on cardiovascular and hypertension issues. We still have other topics to cover like diabetes, erectile dysfunction and prostate problems among others. Please, spread the word to friends and family as it promises to be insightful. There will be opportunities for health checks during each session. God bless and do have a profitable week ahead. #folrccg #grec #bridge #thebridge #mensmentalhealth #menshealthmatters #menshealthawareness #menshealth #africanmenshealth #africanmen #hypertension #erectiledysfunction #diabetes #depression #cardiovasculardisease #prostrate #prostrateissues #aberdeen #aberdeenshire #scotland #unitedkingdom

One day, two people met for lunch. One of them, a chiropractor, has been coping with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome for 10 years and the other, a psychologist, has been dealing with the same for 30 years.  From this meeting, 'The Chronic Dialogues' began - shared experiences of hope, hopelessness, chronic pain, bone-sucking fatigue, desperation and searching, acceptance, and learning what to do when there is no instant cure.  We are two health professionals who have dedicated our energy to treating those with chronic illnesses as well as managing them in our own lives. I hope that our conversations bring hope as we explore ideas around our state of mind while searching for cures, emotional ups, and downs, and what helps….

"From prehistory, through ancient civilizations, and on topresent day societies, emotions have been the cornerstone of all human experiences and actions. Regardless of culture, both painful and pleasant emotions have been the wellsprings of meaning and spirit.However, the 19th century burst of empirical science began quantifying them as data points along with other elements of the natural sciences and largely abandoned their qualitative value. Eventually in the mid to late 20th century, medical science stepped in and re-conceptualized emotions as dysfunctional symptoms of illnesses that stood in the way of productive and efficient human behavior. Thus, the goal became, and continues to be, their elimination through chemical, electrical, and surgical means in order to cure the alleged illnesses. Join us for this year’s conference when we call for a reversal of this medical conceptualization, recapturing the meaningful and valuable nature of emotions as important guideposts to human living and not mere nuisances or signs of pathology to be eradicated.

Teens in Distress? Attention!Is your student or child not studying? Has his /her behavior changed drastically? Is he/she not participating in sports activities?Attention Mentors and Parents!“Depression doesn’t see gender, age, race, or culture. Mild or chronic, teen depression is critical. Support from family and professional care will help them brave the silent enemy known as Depression,” says Ms. Gaganjot Gill - PGT, MRIS MOHALI.According to her, “growing children need our guidance at every step, even though they may think they don’t. At times, we may have to bear their anger and tantrums but parenting is all about patience! Understanding their development can help us support them in becoming independent, responsible adults.”To read this thought-provoking vibe, click on the link here : https://lnkd.in/dvf9GHw4#MRIS #ManavRachna #Blog #Blogoftheweek #NewBlog #Blogpost #Teendepression #depression #anxiety #life #trust #support #help #understanding #peerpressure #peers #safety #feelsafe #mrisvibes #wearemris #Peace #Fitin #Teensproblems #Editor #Author

"Ultimately, there aren't enough providers to help the sheer amount of people who need help. We need to come up with technological solutions ... we have to come up with ways to help the healthcare industry actually address this."Ernie Wallerstein Jr. is the chief executive officer and co-founder of Mental Health Technologies Inc. (MHT), a cloud-based platform that enables health care clinicians to identify patients that may be suffering from undiagnosed or inadequately treated mental health and substance abuse disorders.  "I think every healthcare professional is responsible for the mental wellness of their patients. Mental health is now the number one issue in the world. COVID-19 was bad, but mental health affects way more people than COVID did, and this problem isn't going away. Leveraging a technology like ours helps identify the people who need your time, and helps you treat more efficiently." "Screening for behavioral health and substance abuse should be part of any preventive care philosophy and program."Visit www.mhtech.com to learn more about MHT:https://www.mhtech.com/ #sponsored #innovation #healthtech #mentalheallthstartup #mentalhealthcare #healthcarestartup #mentalhealthawareness #podcast #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthsupport #depression #anxiety  Bill Leonhard, Paige Pontrelli, Jennifer Salas

The process of becoming whole again after experiencing pain. Healing takes time, energy, will, and great support system. When going through life while experiencing pain, you most likely will find yourself on a roller coaster of emotions. One day you are sad without any energy or will to do anything, crying yourself to sleep. The next day you are feeling like yourself again, maybe even throw in a workout or meet with friends, or imagine, even grab a shower and clean your home. Only to realize the day after that everything and everyone around you irritates you, and you feel this anger boiling inside you. So how do you deal with your own mind and emotions? There is a quote by @carolinemyss very close to my heart: “The body knows how to heal itself. The challenge is to silence your mind.” You have few options:- you can repress your feelings, place them in a box somewhere in your mind and throw away the key. I get it, it’s painful and you don’t want to deal with it. That’s quite a normal response - only human. I bet, a lot of other events are also in that box too. Just keep in mind that this mind box needs emptying from time to time, or you will certainly find yourself with overflowing of Pandora’s box of ugliness (every painful event you’ve repressed), which in real life comes unexpectedly. You might caught yourself driving and suddenly crying out of nowhere, or even raging at some complete stranger. - Or, you can face your situation and work through your emotions. Scary I know. Processing pain sometimes is even harder, as it’s in human nature to avoid pain. But do you want to think you are a ok, and years later find yourself dealing with the same pain?

Have you ever experienced any combination of these psychological effects of stress? - anxious, depressed, worried, overwhelmed, mentally exhausted, "burnt out"...While these feelings can be caused by small and large events in our personal and professional lives, stress can affect every aspect of our lives, regardless of the source.International Stress Awareness Week runs from the 7th to the 11th of November. In our search for tips to manage stress, we came across the following suggestions:💡 Keep an open line of communication with a friend, colleague, family member and/or therapist who you trust. Be transparent about how you feel and consider their feedback.💡 Establish a "safe place" that you can retreat to - free of interruptions, email notifications, text alerts, and ringing phones. 15 minutes away from the chaos may be all that you need to recharge each day.💡 Turn the news off. It's good to stay informed, but if it's affecting your mental state, you may be better off not knowing everything.💡 Take care of your body. Eat the right combination of foods and increase your physical activity. Aim for seven or more hours of sleep per night with a similar sleep schedule each day.💡 Make it a habit to mindfully breathe. Deep breathing while stretching has proven to help decrease the effects of stress at that moment.💡 Schedule something fun to look forward to in the near future with people who help bring you joy.💡 Know where to go if you or someone you know needs professional help or more information.#stressawarenessweek #health #selfcare #wellness #mentalhealth #depression #stressrelief #mindfulness

HUGE BREAKTHROUGH - THIS IS NOT A DRILL!! Cope Notes® works... and now, we can prove it.For years, we've known that our solution changes lives. We've seen it firsthand, time and time again, across tens of thousands of users.Heck, we even did a qualitative study with USF Health a couple years back that showed - you guessed it - that Cope Notes really does work.But every time we sat down to discuss a large-scale rollout with a Fortune 100 mainstay or an insurance company, one thing always came up in the conversation:"Where's the hard data?"Well, now you don't have to believe me, or even the thousands of people who regularly report improved mental health within 30 days of using Cope Notes.You can just look at these graphs 🤓📈While the full manuscript awaits its turn in queue for publication (my research friends know how long this can take), I do have permission from USF to share this amazing one-page analysis that says, in short, that...Well, Cope Notes really does work.I don't mean to say "I told ya so," but... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Thank you to Jennifer T., Katie Torres, and one of my dearest friends Dr. Kristin Kosyluk for facilitating this amazing research and Jennifer Johnston of the Gulf Coast Community Foundation and Daniel Maroney, CRPS® of Raymond James for taking action and truly championing mental health innovation.For almost 5 years, we've been working towards a breakthrough - the kind of breakthrough that would blast open new doors of opportunity and usher in a whole new era of impact that dwarfs the work we've done to date.This is that breakthrough.Now let's change - and save - some lives.

Healing isn't easy. Healing is complicated. Healing is uncomfortable. It is a long journey that takes a lot of unexpected turns. It takes a lot of time and patience. It takes so much of courage to even think of pulling yourself out of the darkness. It takes you to be really strong both emotionally and mentally. The most difficult thing about healing is that it takes you to face your trauma and fear. In order to get you out of the darkness, it asks you to first get yourself in the darkness. It takes you to feel the hurt and the pain and let it pass through you. It takes you to suffer in order to end the suffering.  It asks you to keep believing that you will get better even when you see no sign of hope. It asks you to keep having faith that you will recover when you've got all the reasons to believe that you won't. Honestly, healing isn't any less painful than the suffering itself. But healing is worth the pain, because on the other side of healing, lies hope, happiness, and a new and better 'you'. https://lnkd.in/du6wPHVD#healing #mentalhealth #healingjourney #mentalhealthrecovery #hopeandhealing #mentalhealthwarrior #depression #anxietyanddepression #anxiety #mentalhealthisimportant #mentalillness #suffering

Earlier this week, the CDC issued a report on the data collected by #MaternalMortality Review Committees (MMRCs) in 36 U.S. states from 2017 to 2019, concluding that >84% of pregnancy-related deaths are PREVENTABLE and the overall leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths are suicide & overdose.MMRCs are multidisciplinary committees that convene at the state or local level to comprehensively review deaths during or within a year of #pregnancy. MMRCs have access to clinical and non-clinical information to more fully understand the circumstances surrounding each death, determine whether the death was pregnancy-related, and develop recommendations for action to prevent similar deaths in the future.Key Findings:✦  Among deaths with information on timing, 22% occurred during pregnancy, 25% on or within seven days of delivery, 23% seven days to forty-two days after pregnancy, and 30% forty-three to 365 days after pregnancy.✦  Leading causes:  ➤  Mental health conditions (including suicide and overdose; 23%)  ➤  Excessive bleeding / hemorrhage (14%)  ➤  Cardiac and coronary conditions (13%)  ➤  Infection (9%)  ➤  Thrombotic embolism (9%)  ➤  Cardiomyopathy (9%)  ➤  Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (7%)✦  While women of color are disproportionally impacted, the leading causes varied by race and ethnicity: cardiac and coronary conditions among Black people; mental #health conditions among Hispanic and white people; hemorrhage among Asian people; and #mentalhealth conditions & hemorrhage among American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) people.“The report paints a much clearer picture of pregnancy-related deaths in this country,” said Wanda Barfield, M.D., M.P.H., director of CDC’s Division of Reproductive Health. “The majority of pregnancy-related deaths were preventable, highlighting the need for quality improvement initiatives in states, hospitals, and communities that ensure all people who are pregnant or #postpartum get the right care at the right time.” Learn how EVERYONE can help prevent pregnancy-related deaths, why MMRCs are the best source for prevention strategies, and more: ow.ly/KF8g50KPKXA#maternalmentalhealth #perinatalmentalhealth #stress #anxiety #depression #PTSD #trauma #postpartumanxiety #postpartumdepression #postpartumpsychosis #bipolar #postpartumOCD #postpartumPTSD #suicideprevention #substanceusedisorder #prenatal #perinatal #wellness #maternalhealth #womenshealth #OBGYN #behavioralhealth #publichealth #reproductivehealth #psychiatry #reproductivepsychiatry #MCH #maternalchildhealth #maternalandchildhealth #birth #childbirth #baby #family #community #blackmaternalhealth #blackmamasmatter #healthequity #maternalhealthequity #birthequity #SDOH #publicpolicy #women #mom #motherhood #MMHadvocacy #maternalMHmatters #HearHer #MaternalSuicideAwareness #KnowMomFacts #MomsAreNotImmune #suicidepreventionmonth #NationalSuicidePreventionMonth #mentalhealthawareness

Poner límites es una deber para  con nosotros mismos, que nos permite ponernos a salvo de abusos y atender a nuestras propias necesidades. Lo cual incluye el lugar físico, mental y emocional donde nos sentimos a salvo, nuestra zona segura.Pero para ello tenemos que reconocer y aceptar propios nuestros límites: tenemos derecho a equivocarnos, a fallar, a enfadarnos o tener miedo. Sin culparnos ni avergonzarnos por no ser perfectos en todo.Parece fácil, verdad? Pues no… no es fácil y el que diga lo contrario miente!

Starting or expanding your telepsychiatry program? Our provider group can help you serve more patients and see them in a timely manner. We make it easy.ITP was formed as a result of evaluating the options community mental health centers had for addressing coverage gaps from a shortage of psychiatric providers. These facilities face significant recruiting costs and a lengthy recruiting process to find full-time providers and are oftentimes faced with the decision to either pay a premium to an out-of-state telepsychiatry agency or not provide care. Today, we not only partner with community mental health centers to provide care, but we work with hospital emergency departments, county jails, federally qualified health centers, substance use disorder facilities, crisis centers, primary care physician offices, rural health clinics, and other outpatient facilities nationally and have providers available in every time zone, nationwide.To learn more about ITP, please contact us today. https://pos.li/2maa6s#ITPConnect #WorkFromHome #depression #Telepsychiatry #MentalHealthMatters #psychiatry #wecanhelp #communitymentalhealth #psychiatricproviders

« Chimpanzé (tu m’as monkey) » - Je n’ai pas vu mon fils les 18 premiers mois de sa vie.  Je n’ai pas voulu voir qu’il était là. Comme je n’ai pas voulu voir que ma femme était en dépression post-partum. Papa, où t'es? J’ai préféré me défoncer au boulot. Parce que c’est fier un homme! C’est con comme c’est fier. Mon fils est né un 23 novembre, en pleine clôture des états financiers. Il n’est pas responsable de ça. Au Père Noël, il avait demandé un père. Pas un directeur de filiale. J’ai pris deux semaines de congés de paternité à sa naissance sur les cinq auxquelles j’avais droit. Et j’ai bossé 100% du temps pendant ces deux semaines-là. Il n’y a pas pire Boss que soi-même. Les neufs premiers mois, nous n’avons pas dormi ma femme et moi. Mon fils hurlait. Je me levais cinq à six fois par nuit en maugréant « Putain, mais c’est Balavoine au Palais des Sports ou quoi!? » Mon fils, ma bataille. Pourtant, j’ai refusé de me battre. Alors je suis parti dans un trip. Je me suis shooté aux business trips. Voyages au bout de la nuit. Septembre 2018: New YorkOctobre: ParisJanvier 2019: Los AngelesAvril: New York puis Beverly HillsMai: New York de nouveauJuillet: Las VegasSeptembre: ParisOctobre: TorontoDécembre: VancouverJanvier 2020: Los AngelesEn plus d'avoir un bilan carbone de salopard, j’étais devenu un père et un mari absent. Seul au comptoir des bars d'hôtels, des aéroports, et des restaurants. Par chance, le coronavirus est arrivé. La pandémie m’a stoppé net dans cette spirale infernale. Du jour au lendemain, j’étais cloué au sol comme les avions sur le tarmac. Ma femme travaillait en RH en milieu manufacturier. Elle est devenue instantanément infirmière, assistante sociale, juriste, pompière, experte santé-sécurité au travail, gestionnaire multitâches, bureau des pleurs… On s’est partagé les journées et la garde de nos enfants à la maison pendant le confinement. Je suis devenu deux fois plus productif. J’ai signé des contrats en changeant des couches. J’ai signé des couches en changeant des contrats. J’ai imposé aux clients mon style, mon rythme, mes règles du jeu. Le cellulaire à l’oreille, une lingette à la main. Un mélange hydroalcoolique de Monsieur Propre et de Victor, le nettoyeur (Salut les fans de Jean Reno!). Et j’ai découvert mon fils. Peu à peu, peau à peau. La beauté de son visage blond. De ses yeux verts. Son rire. Ses sourires. J’ai vu qu’il était différent. Parfaitement différent. Comme son papa. J'ai dit: « J’ai compris pourquoi tu pleurais. Papa est là maintenant. Papa sera toujours là. » J’ai écrit une chanson pour lui. Pour lui demander pardon. Pour lui dire que je l’aime. Pour le remercier de m’avoir sauvé de moi-même. Je mets le lien en commentaires. 👇À tous les papas, prenez soin de vous, de votre conjoint.e, de vos enfants. It's just a job. 👉 Défi #linkedin - 90 posts en 90 jours: Jour 29 💪#santémentale #hommes #paternity #papa #depression #workaholics #ceo #travail

Today is International Men’s Day focused on men’s health, improving gender relations, highlighting male role models, and promoting positive expressions of masculinity. As a clinical research network, we are keenly aware of mens mental health and the challenges many men face in sharing their struggle. According to the Mental Health Foundation, approximately 1-in-8 men have a common mental health problem such as anxiety, stress, or depression. When left unattended, these problems can worsen and be detrimental to those affected. If you, or someone you love is struggling with a mental health condition, we encourage you to speak out, talk about what feelings are being experienced, and seek treatment.

A recent article in Cell Rep https://lnkd.in/eBfh3WpU showed that the inflammasome plays an essential role in depression in mice. Chronic stress activates the NF-kB pathway triggering the activation of the inflammasome in microglia. This leads to the secretion of cytokines that activate astrocytes. Inhibiting NLRP3 activity in microglia reduced the induction of neurotoxicity in astrocytes and subsequent depression-like behavior in stressed mice.https://lnkd.in/eP3dqP-j#genetics #genomics #precisionmedicine #depression #brain #neurology #neuroscience #glia #neurodegeneration #behaviour #inflammation #neuroinflammation #innovation #therapeutics #research #science #sciencecommunication

"A new study has confirmed what traditional practices like yoga, pranayama, qigong, and meditation have held for thousands of years: that breathing doesn’t just provide oxygen, but it also affects our emotions, attention, and how we make sense of the world around us. The researchers reviewed both animal and human studies and found that the rhythm of our brains is closely linked to the rhythm of our breath. Difficulty breathing is associated with mood disorders like depression and anxiety. This study sheds light on why practices like yoga and qigong help stabilize mood." #breath #breathe #breathwork #breathing #brain #yoga #pranayama #meditation #mood #emotions #depression #anxiety #mentalhealth

'I took magic mushrooms at 64 and the fog I've lived under my whole life lifted' Shorney, 64, had been living with depression since his 20s, trying medication, running and meditation to lift what had become a decades-long fog. When he heard a radio interview on the subject of psilocybin – the active compound in magic mushrooms – being used to treat depression in clinical trials, he signed up, was accepted, and experienced “the most rewarding day of my life”. https://bit.ly/3Ev8Cck#psychedelics #psilocybin #mentalhealth #depression #therapy #wellness

Great job from the Anima team (Anima Research Center)!They successfully included 21 Link2Trials referred subjects in their study on the driving ability of adults and elderly patients suffering from depression (Major Depressive Disorder).This study looks at the effect of a single dose and repeated doses of an investigational medication on next-day driving performance when taken in addition to a participant’s current antidepressant medication. Doctors want to learn how the investigational medication affects next-day driving, sleep, how well it is tolerated, and the side effects it may cause.We are grateful that we could help Anima Research Center with the recruitment for this study.Thank you Theresa Lo Gullo for trusting us with this important project.#animaresearchcenter #depression #clinicaltrial #clinicalresearch #patientrecruitment

Depression is a multi-faceted disorder which encompasses a diversity of neuropsychological and socio-behavioral factors, with depressed individuals tending to experience a distorted perception of time. Depressive individuals find time passes slowly and are preoccupied with the past. The cause(s) of such disturbance remains to be investigated, with the nature of past events in life hypothesized to be a probable potentiating factor. The hypoactivity of the brain’s basal ganglia region, which is related to decreased response to positive stimuli, hence emotional valence, may be associated with subjective slowness of time as perceived by depressed subjects. Time distortion appears more pronounced in studies of long interval than short interval ranges. Time perception has a consolidating role which oversees and links various neuropsychological and socio-behavioral aspects of an individual’s internal interactions with the external world, therefore affecting one’s prognosis in depression. It also has a modulatory and interfering influence on perceptual objectivity due to its high sensitivity to emotional valence.source: https://lnkd.in/g6NHVrPT Please like or share, if you choose to donate to my Movember page please visit https://lnkd.in/gaeCcen2Movember #Movember #menshealthmonth #help #donate #depressionawareness #sucideprevention #men #fyp #mental #health #sad #need #save #savelives #matter #light #healthmotivation #November #2022year #depression #work

Vilken behandling bör min medarbetare få för sitt utmattningssyndrom?Enligt Socialstyrelsen bör behandlingen baseras på psykologiskt stöd för att skapa balans mellan aktivitet och #vila, för att undvika återinsjuknande. Behandlingen bör också inriktas på att understödja #sömn och minska #oro. Sömnstörning är vanligt och regelbundna vanor och fysisk aktivitet spelar en avgörande roll både för symtomförbättring och för arbetsåtergång. Det är vanligt med samsjuklighet vid #utmattningssyndrom. Om medarbetaren har ångestproblem eller #depression  bör #samtalsbehandling erbjudas även för dessa problem. Avstämningsmöte med arbetsgivaren, medarbetaren, läkare, terapeut( eller annan vårdpersonal) och Försäkringskassan är mycket värdefullt. Det ökar chanserna till en lyckad återgång i arbetet. Här diskuteras medarbetarens aktuella #arbetsförmåga och möjligheter till anpassning på arbetsplatsen. En plan för återgång i arbetet upprättas. Arbetsåtergång sker successivt med arbetsuppgifter som är anpassade till medarbetarens kognitiva och fysiska förmåga.  Vid hel #sjukskrivning är det vanligt att man vid arbetsåtergång börjar med 25 procent arbete innan ytterligare upptrappning sker i lugn takt.Vänliga hälsningar Lars NordelvKBT-och parterapeutHälsorådgivare

Can Depression Be Prevented?In all honesty, there is no foolproof way to prevent depression. However, there are some things you can do to reduce your risk. Here are some tips:- Keep your social life active. Go out with friends or meet new ones. Visit your family or let them visit you.- Do not neglect your hobbies and seek new activities that may interest you. Do things that you enjoy.- Stay healthy. Eat the right meals, exercise regularly, drink plenty of water, and get adequate sleep every night.#HomeCare #BrewsterNY #Depression

#RelationshipStressors - Role of Psychiatrist- #Relationshipstress can take a toll on the strongest of bonds. When you begin to think “My relationship is stressing me out,” there is the potential for distance, disagreements and disconnection between you and your partner- Dealing with relationship stress is never easy, but it’s part of life. Even if your partner has consistently been the anchor in your relationship, there will eventually come a time when their tank is running on empty and you will be given the opportunity to provide the love and support that is needed. And while you may find it to be difficult to help your partner during times of stress, generating the mental and emotional resources to help your partner will not only create comfort and connection but a healthy, secure base in the relationship that both partners can consistently count on.- Hectic schedules and everyday work-life demands make it easy to become wrapped up in our own worlds. But when we lose sight of our partner’s stress, then we are not communicating and we are not connecting. This is why it is imperative to make the extra effort to recognize when you’re dealing with a stressed partner.- Relationship stress can lead to #mentalhealthproblems like:- #Anxiety when you are around your partner- Over analysis of your interactions- Inability to control your emotions- Feeling depressed or withdrawn- Problems sleepingRelationship stress results in the same negative health effects as any other form of stress:- Stomach issues- Skin problems- Increased risk of heart disease- High blood pressure- Weaker immune systemManagement involves ruling out and managing psychiatric disorders like #OCD or #Depression.

Your worth is not defined by what others think of you. It's defined by the way you think about yourself.It's important to give yourself grace and remember that you cannot please everyone, it's impossible. By doing what is best for your mental and physical health you are improving your overall happiness and level of wellbeing. This is something to be proud of.If you have a tend to be perfectionistic or a people pleaser, you may find it helpful to start small and practice saying no to less important things first, and then work on these skills over time. ...#boundaries #guilt #shame #blame #peoplepleasing #mentalhealth #mentalhealthadvocate #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthsupport #selflove #selflovequotes #selfcare #selfcaretips #selfloveclub #therapy #depression #depressionhelp #anxiety #anxietyawareness #anxietyrelief #anxietyhelp #anxietyrecovery #apartmenttherapy #trauma #traumahealing #traumainformed #telehealthcare #psychologytoday #californiatherapy

A recent poll conducted by the American Psychological Association highlighted some of the biggest stressors American adults are currently facing:   -  Inflation (83%)   -  Violence/crime (75%)   -  Political climate (66%)   -  Racial climate (62%)There has been an uptick in people meeting diagnostic criteria for clinically impairing depression, anxiety, and substance use that I see in my day-to-day therapeutic work, but those diagnostic labels don't provide a usable path forward for resolving the major issues that are causing these mental health conditions in the first place.  Sure, there are coping skills that can be used to reduce the intensity of depressive or anxiety symptoms, but until the source of the stressors are addressed, coping skills are just a band-aid for a wound that might require a more intensive intervention.If you're experiencing depression, anxiety, or noticed yourself drinking more than usual, there is a reason why those things are happening.  It sounds trivial, but acknowledging that there is a legitimate reason why you are feeling and experiencing any of these symptoms can help to foster resiliency and reduce racing thoughts related to all of these societal-level issues impacting mental health right now.  #mentalhealth #mentalhealthmatters #stressawareness #resiliency #acknowledge #validate #emotionalhealth #depression #anxiety #substanceabuse #apa

We hold on through fear, the unknown and through the misunderstanding of something new. We fear that if we let go we will have nothing left, be without and alone. Yet the truth is we can only take hold of something new with an open hand, palm upturned and ready to embrace the new. If we keep a closed grip, it becomes tighter and we have no space to take on something new. We begin to experience pain, either physical, emotional or mentally and it becomes the normal. We learn to live with it as our baseline and eventually believe it is what we deserve. The letting go is scary as it invites the unknown territory and path that we fear. For as much pain is caused by the known and already experienced, the unknown holds a greater weight. So instead of letting go all at once, do it little by little. Sit in the comfort of its achievement before letting go again. Then release a little more, and eventually you will have let go and will be ready for all that is patiently awaiting for you to begin living once more.  #communication #parenting #growth #learning #trauma #walls #boundaries #healing #healingjourney #healingtrauma #trauma #traumahealing #traumarecovery #defences #depression #depressionrecovery #mentalhealthmatters #mentalbreakdown #recovery #awareness #mindfulness #grief #grieving #beforeandafter #understanding #embracethejourney #embraceyourself #embracechange #help #childhoodtrauma #experience

This quote right here!! This is mental health. When we shift to believe what God says about us instead of people and the world. It is freeing when you genuinely believe that God loves you. I pray for God's grace over you to believe what God says about you. #christianmentalhealth #freedom #salvation #JesusChrist #christiantherapist #christiancounselor #depression #anxiety #traumahealing #trauma

Un série très intéressante à écouter...et se faire sa propre idée. ..À propos de la sérieLa #psychogénéaologie émet l'hypothèse que notre vie serait influencée par les expériences des générations antérieures. Un évènement vécu par un ancêtre pourrait guider nos choix à notre insu. En prendre #conscience permettrait-il de reprendre les rênes de sa destinée ?Rechercher les empreintes #psychologiques inconscientes laissées par nos ancêtres comme des traces de pas sur le sable, pour éclairer nos comportements actuels et nous en libérer : voilà l'approche transgénérationnelle portée par #thérapeutes, #sociologues, #universitaires, #écrivains. Ce questionnement n'émergerait pas seulement dans le cabinet des psychologues mais à l'occasion de l'apparition d'une maladie, d'un échec répété, de relations mère-enfant difficiles, de secrets scellés dans les pans cachés de notre héritage. Sommes-nous conditionnés par des loyautés, des traumatismes ou des hontes invisibles ?France Culture rediffuse cette série d'émissions de 2005 qui rend compte d'un engouement pour la question des transmissions intergénérationnelles. Nous rappelons que la psychogénéalogie est une discipline qui fait l'objet de vifs débats et critiques. #culture #maladie #psychanalyse #santé #Œdipe #Freud #Lacan #Winnicott #Nasio #livre #MelanieKlein #Jung #Dolto #angoisse #symptôme #pathologie #care #pulsion #psychisme #bienetre #santé #psy #depression #borderline #santeautravail #psychiatrie #psychanalyse #psy #pathologie #santementale #therapie #medecine #hôpitaux #dirigeant #Luxembourg #Paris #Bordeaux #sexualité #sexo #addiction #couple #violence #agressivité #stress #sante-publique #neuropsychiatrie #pedopsychiatrie #pediatrie #chirurgie #troubledusommeil #enfant #children #recherches #journalisme #philosophie #sociétal #etude #clinique #Bion #analyse #anthropologie #sociologie #maladie #art #culture #entreprise #work #neuroscience #gouvernement #politique #épidémie #vaccination #alternative #pathologie #douleur #physique #reseauxsociaux

The #Science Of #Gratitude - a free workshop and practice. " In many #cultures throughout history gratitude was considered the key to good fortune and a #meaningful life. Scientific #research suggests that gratitude leads to #happiness, better #health, closer #relationships, a sense of #connection, more #energy, #self-confidence, and more #positive #emotions, as well as #reducing #stress, #anxiety, and #depression. Cultivating gratitude is an important way to build #physical and #mental #health. After this workshop, you will have an understanding of how gratitude impacts the body and why we need gratitude given how our #brains evolved. We will also take a look at ideas about gratitude from different #ancient #traditions and try several gratitude #meditations together (including self-appreciation). This will be a way of coming together and preparing for Thanksgiving together. We hope to see you there."

I have learned a lot from her practical as well as a scientifically founded approach to how nutrition and foods influence mental health.And I use all I learned in her Practitioner programs for the benefit of my clients when I coach them around weight loss, gut health, and mental health issues.If you want to chat with me about any of this - whether for yourself, a loved one - or your clients, let me know. #mentalhealth #guthealth #obesity #microbiome #brainhealth #brain #autism, #depression #anxiety #ASD #ADHD #nutrition #diet #metabolism #gut #IBS #IBD #nutrigenomics #bioindividual

Did you know that your brains 🧠job is to keep you safe and alive. But the most overlooked fact is that your brain isn’t wired to make you happy. The main purpose of your brain is to keep you safe and make sure you survive. Your body, and particularly your brain, don’t care whether you’re happy.👉️It also doesn't care if what you say is right or wrong, true or false,  so make sure you tell it positive things.  When people sit in anxiety, fear, trauma, the way or brain is wired, it actually thinks it's doing a great job at keeping you alive, because you didn't die yesterday from anxiety, so it gives you more of it.  It is simply your brain mis reading what is going on.  So, tell yourself a better lie!#margariatpolitistransforminglives #roar #realorganicauthenticresults #recoverrebootrefuel #depression #psychology #science #anxiety #awareness #stress #mind #brainhealth #fatigue

Our study of Paul’s “Prison Epistles” continues with the beloved Epistle to the Philippians. The apostle, now an elderly statesman of the Gospel, was under house arrest, and unable to travel. Nevertheless, though bound by Caesar, Paul was a prisoner of the Lord (Ephesians 3:1; 4:1), and his heart was infused with the joy of ministering to believers. What was Paul’s secret to joy? #Philippi, #Philippians, #Joy, #Love, #Depression, #Sorrow, #Paul, #Prison,

People living with depression are more likely to feel isolated, lonely, and worthless. Because of this, depression wasn’t really openly discussed (nor was mental health in general) until VERY recently. If you’re living with depression and you feel comfortable talking about it, don’t be afraid to do so! Millions of people are living with the same feelings you are, and the more we openly discuss it, the more we can learn.Connect with Gifted By Design trusted Affiliate Partner and Certified Professional Leavell Counseling, LLC is a private practice committed to providing quality clinical and mental health.

Happy Thanksgiving everyone!  I have so much to be thankful for.  Almost 20 years ago, I had a dream...and I just realized it came true with the help of this sign from Jersey Signs & Vehicle Graphics It was a dream I told very few about - not even some family - but kept very close to my heart; a one stop place of health.  Not just of the body, but of the mind and spirit as well.  At the time, I thought it was just that - a dream. Something to strive for.  And now, its happened a little differently than I envisioned it, but it's happened nonetheless. The only thing missing is a fitness center.  Oh wait, we're literally LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES FROM ONE.Don't lose sight of your dreams, and they will never fail you. ☕ Isn't it time you became the most authentic version of you?

Here’s why you get gloomy in the winter — and what you can do about itWith the arrival of winter, many of us experience Seasonal Affective Disorder — which bears the appropriate acronym of SAD — and can bring on a depressed mood, loss of interest in things that you normally enjoy, and changes in sleep and appetite.

The Declaration of the Rights of the Child is an international document promoting children’s rights. It was originally proposed by the human rights activist Eglantyne Jebb and adopted by the League of Nations in 1924 before an extended version was introduced by the United Nations in 1959.The child that is hungry must be fed, the child that is sick must be nursed, the child that is backward must be helped, the delinquent child must be reclaimed, and the orphan and the waif must be sheltered and succored. #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #selfcare #selflove #anxiety #love #mentalhealthmatters #depression #motivation #health #wellness #mindfulness #healing #fitness #life #loveyourself #therapy #inspiration #happiness #mindset #positivity #positivevibes #quotes #meditation #mentalillness #psychology #wellbeing #recovery #instagood #happy

Life is full of detours. Even the best plans sometimes come to nothing. But does that mean you should stop trying? Of course not!When you’re diagnosed with a chronic illness, it can feel like one of the biggest detours you’ve ever been on. Suddenly, you’re being redirected down roads you never knew existed. And at times, it’s terrifying.A nurse called to tell me I had gastroparesis. Yet another box on my chronic illness bingo card received its dab.The nurse told me I could never again eat fresh fruits and vegetables, meat, or nuts. The news was crushing.It was an unexpected detour, but one that led to dozens of new recipes. I learned what I could eat and when it was safe. The way I ate changed to a slower, more deliberate process. Now, I savor each bite, chewing longer to grind up every morsel.Despite what the nurse told me, it wasn’t the end of my journey.Detours can be wonderful. When you’re forced to drive down a road you’ve never been on before, you’ll often see amazing sights. Maybe you’ll find a beautiful old building hidden in a forgotten area of your town or glimpse a sunset in a breathtakingly unique setting.These are only road detours. Detours in life can be just as beautiful.You never know what you can do until you face a situation where you have to do it. I never imagined I could work full time with both mental illness and chronic illness, but yet I do it every day. My detours taught me what I can do.For today, think about the detours you’ve taken. What new things have you learned along the way?

- Lack of support structures and guidelines⁠- Structural under-resourcing⁠- Adherence to outdated modes of working⁠- Values mismatch⁠⁠When I read this I hit every single on of these aspects in my jobs over the last 10 years. And each and every time they are the reasons I left a job. ⁠⁠I didn't realise however, that going from job to job I wasn't really learning my lessons. ⁠⁠- I didn't learn how to set boundaries⁠- I didn't learn how to speak up when I wasn't ok ⁠- I felt like I had to just do it all and get it done whilst drowning. ⁠- I allowed myself to be mistreated, underpaid and overworked.⁠- I also realised I wasn't really aligned with this line of work. ⁠⁠Which brought me here. ⁠⁠I was meant for more! ⁠⁠I was meant for something else. ⁠⁠I was meant to help others in a significant way. ⁠⁠How did I get here?⁠⁠I started my own personal development journey. I never realised my self worth, I never realised that I was ok to not be ok. I never realised that this wasn't the path I was truly meant to take. ⁠⁠So I ask, if any of the above resonates with you. What are you here to really do?⁠⁠#Bekindlyyou #inspirationalmindset #personaldevelopment #motivation #personalgrowth #inspiration #success #stress #anxiety #mentalhealth #depression #stressrelief #selfcare #wellness #stressmanagement #meditation #mentalhealthawareness #corporate #healing #relax #selflove #burnout #yoga #covid #mindset #coaching #psychology #wellbeing #trauma #mentalhealthmatters

S.A.D - Seasonal Affective Disorder; Changes in seasons (including environment, weather and time) can effect our Mental Health, causing depression and other symptoms that can lead to serious concerns. S.A.D typically begins to effect those with a higher chance of the disorder around the same times every year. You may find symptoms starting in the fall, usually around seasonal time changes and continue into the winter months, draining your emotions, energy and physical state. Often becoming easily agitated, and less interested in daily activities.Depending on severity and other Mental Illnesses treatments for S.A.D may involve light therapy, psychotherapy and medications to treat symptoms. You are not alone in your 'Winter Blues' battles. Take them serious, take the proper steps to taking care of yourself, regulating your Thoughts, Behaviors and Emotions throughout the tougher, darker months and year.
