Layoffs are happening aggressively on a big scale. There is havoc everywhere and I am witnessing that from an uncertain edge. Engineers ofany level,any work experience,any profile, are getting fired and facing difficulties during these days. The economic conditions are forcing companies to take this kind of actions and no one is safe from this. There was a time when I was reading articles related to productivity, money management, promotions and all. Now I am reading about Layoffs, Hiring Freezes, Severance and what not. Twitter Layoff was just a news to me, but when I saw things happening with my friends and connections I got to know the real impact.Our lives are heavily dependent on our jobs and this makes the situation more difficult. This is a high time to upskill and invest more in ourselves.If you are looking for a new job then Get Hired with GeeksforGeeks  Jobathon is a big opportunity for you.You can apply for 1.

Meta is laying off more than 11,000 people. Twitter laid off 3,700 people, more than 50% of its workforce. Stripe cuts 14% of its workforces. Snap laid off 20% of the company. Many other tech companies follow suit and hiring is on a big freeze! 😔The tech industry is in a precarious situation right now.

Can anyone tell me what to do when you are ghosted by Companies after completing all the rounds of interviews. In last 4 months, its been like 5-6 companies that ghosted me. No rejection. No acceptance. I have tried Emails as well as reaching out to hiring managers and interview conductors via Linkedin but so far no success.  Also anyone who is reading this, can suggest me for any openings in Germany related to SCM and Project Management. It would be a great help with this layoff trending. #layoff #counteroffer #ghosting #hiringfreeze

I’ve been lucky almost all through my career to have had managers who ended up becoming friends. Is it really luck though?At a time when #hiringfreeze and #layoffs are the trending hashtags, I’m not even sure if I should be writing about this. Let me tell you how I found these wonderful people though who have mentored me through my life and stood up for me when it mattered the most:Being an introvert, I never really talk much- not even during interviews. Sure, I am eager to showcase my work and talk about who I am as a person, but beyond that I almost always just let the recruiter/manager ask me questions. Some of the questions they ask really tells me a lot about what they value in a person and tells me a lot about what they expect out of me. Here are some of the questions that stood out for me:1. What does your schedule look like? What happens on days when you’re experiencing writers block? (I had talked about my love for content writing just before that. By this time in the interview I was comfortable enough to know that there was no wrong answer)2. Are you a morning person or an evening person? (she made it a point to tell me after I answered the question as to why she asked this question and why it really mattered to her)3. What do you do when something you tried doesn’t work and how do you cheer yourself up afterward? (After I gave the answer- the recruiter said “I really hope you’re not saying this just because it’s an interview” and I could hear the earnestness in his voice 😂)4. Why marketing? (I was making a move from sales to marketing then)Most of these questions came at the point of the interview where I knew they were convinced about my work prowess and just wanted to get to know me as a person. Their responses to my answers also told me that they were aware that not everything I did would work and ironic as it sounds, marketing is a humbling profession. I could tell that they were going to be great mentors and more importantly, friends who I am still in touch with. Friends who I call upon, when I’m at my lowest. #marketingcareer

Pursuing a software engineering degree feels like the worst decision right now. Every where I see, its bad news of layoff, hiring freeze, etc. People with years of experience in top IT companies are look for jobs.So, for a person with zero experience in the tech industry, it seems like a highway to hell 😔 Hope there is some good news on the other side.P.S.

Buckle up because I’m even amazed by what I’m about to write but hear me out. After seeing how inhumanely the Twitter layoffs were last week. It’s a breath of fresh air to see other leaders take notes from other leaders that led with empathy-first. We probably all have our critics about the leader of Meta but I’ll give credit where it’s due. As the official statement hit a few crucial elements: - Accountability: many companies had a hiring surge in 2020 and we’re seeing the ripple effect of it now. But being able to admit when you may have bitten more than you can chew as a leader is important. Transparency and vulnerability are great sides of a great leader. - Inclusion: immigration policies are a major concern for employees on visas so it’s great to see that Meta has specialists ready to step in to offer advice. - Clear severance package = bills don’t pause when folks are laid off so it’s great to see clear details about what compensation employees will receive. Including insurance cover!  - Humanisation of employees: Mark acknowledged the great talent he’ll be letting go and his appreciation for all they’re contributed to the company. Read the full statement here: https://lnkd.in/e6xmMm9xI for one would like to see more companies ensuring that their laid off employees don’t remain left in the dark (especially in a cost of living crisis). Treating people with respect is the bare minimum–afterall employees are the heart and soul of any business. In the future, prospect employees will be looking back to see how leaders handled ‘unprecedented times’ and if they lead with empathy. #MetaLayoffs #HiringFreeze #Leadership #ImmigrationSuppport #Empathy #Accountablity

Something unprecedented is happening at Meta that has never happened in its entire 18 year history: There is a hiring freeze across the entire company, even for those who have joined and are in bootcamp.For context, bootcamp is where most software engineers start after they join Meta. During the program, engineers take classes to better understand the company and then choose a team. Almost all bootcampers are now stranded, unable to join a team.This situation, alongside so many others at Big Tech, is part of a growing trend where software engineers really need to learn how to make the most of less than ideal situations.For more information about this historic Meta hiring freeze and our advice on how to continue being a great software engineer no matter what the circumstances, check out our expert advice here: https://lnkd.in/gk_XuRxD#techcareergrowth #meta #bootcamp #hiringfreeze #bigtech #softwareengineering #growthtips

What could go wrong in a job search? preparation , interview rounds, anxiety, internet connection nah #no_offer after going through four rounds, 3 zoom calls and an assignment all done diligently and finally got selected , delightfully waiting for the offer letter to be released but as days became weeks ( 3weeks) also constant following up via emails and calls Cashfree Payments the only response was we ll get back to you as soon as possible! Today, after 40 long days the ice was broke and I got a call from Cashfree Payments  quoting , "we apologise on the delay we would advise you to take up any relevant opportunities which comes by , reconsidering the vacancy !"The question is why was it open in the first place? to hire people with the correct set of skills right!?, well aware that the #recession2022  is happening globally and #hiringfreeze is happening , but incidents like these can break the morale of a candidate #me all I'm asking to Cashfree Payments Reeju Datta Akash S. Sapna Sukumar Veena Naidu  time should be valued both the candidate's and the firm's if a freeze is gonna happen could have just stopped the interview process before this stage or at least giving an intimation at the earliest would not have built hopes, also made me inactive in my job search which is human nature . Writing this post to highlight after #3weeks no offer is still initiated ! I would like to suggest the humble management to please take an extra effort and let the candidates know about #hiringfreeze  at the earliest! I hope this post reaches to Cashfree Payments  management.!qoute- " The most hardest pill to be swallowed by any individual is their geniune efforts going in vein, not recognised, over stepped etc🙂.#recession #hiringfreeze #fintechindustry #layoffs #globalrecession #sharemax Cashfree Payments

#layoffs suck no matter what. But when I see large layoffs right before the holidays it really makes my insides cringe. There are many companies on a #hiringfreeze  right now, and many others that have filled their 2022 headcount and won’t be #hiring until next year some time. My advice to those affected– don’t let that deter you!! You should absolutely #apply to positions through the holiday season- if for no other reason than the fact that you’ll have less competition [many folks take a break from job searching during the holiday season]. Make connections with hiring leaders and follow their posts; make yourself visible by commenting on their threads. #follow companies you are interested in to stay up to date on what's going on with them.Cruise is hiring NOW.

📉 TECH FREEFALL! 👨‍💼 A startling number of layoffs and hiring freezes have been announced by tech companies.📢 The latest news came on Wednesday, with Meta  announcing the layoff of around 11,000 employees, or roughly 13% of its workforce.One of the largest layoffs this year and the first in Meta's 18-year existence.📢 Salesforce  laid off hundreds of employees on Monday, with stating the number of layoffs could potentially reach 2500.📢 Last week, Amazon  announced that it is pressing pause of corporate hiring. 📢 At the same time, Apple  allegedly imposed a hiring freeze, with the exception of R&D.📢 Lyft  intends to lay off 13% of its workforce, nearly 700 of its 5000 employees.📢 Stripe  and Chime  will lay off more than 12% of their employees.‼️ According to a report, tech sector layoffs have now risen to more than 52,000 this year. With Thanksgiving just around the corner, the next two weeks are critical. Companies may not want to lay off staff around the holidays because it might harm business morale, immobilize those who did maintain their positions, and damage future hiring.#layoffs #hiringfreeze #techhiring

💭 🗯💭  Being ⛔️ laid off is not a reflection of who you are as a professional or as a person. However, I believe, how it is done is 💯a reflection of the character of "the 🗣 real person, professional, leadership, values and culture of the organization". Heard of many ongoing silent and mass layoffs in Meta, Twitter and others, what are your thoughts? how would you do it? how would you want it to be done to you (wish not), if your role was saved?  👉I am certain that most business owners and decision makers would agree that letting go an employee is a horrible experience for everyone involved. 👉I have personal experience of downsizing the team and having these difficult in-person conversations with my fellow colleagues, strategizing necessary cuts to keep the ship sailing. To the extent, in the past I have created a termination plan for my manager and myself as well, without being too fretful.🔔My question ... #leaders #talent #leadership #talentacquisition #talentmanagement #executiveleadership #humanresourcesprofessional #hr #hiringfreeze #termination #corporatelife #socialresponsibility ◾️ Does it matter, how it is done? ◾️ Gracefully / ungracefully? ◾️ Who decides it, firm culture or the leader?🔖I believe that graceful etiquettes for firing an Employee do matter, and is a characteristic of a good leader and a reflection of the firm’s culture. 🔰Every employee (without serious policy violations) deserves the right to:🔰A heads up, leaving the element of surprise out🔰Know the reason for the termination or layoff🔰Private conversation about the dismissal🔰Compassion and time to leave in a respectable mannerStay strong, be well!

Many CEOs who fired their workers don't feel bad about it. Their short, pitiful messages on social media about being laid off mean, "You are no longer good enough to retain"One of the people who lost their job was my wonderful colleague, who is by far one of the best training managers I've ever worked with.This made me think about how hard it must be to figure out who is really valuable to your company and who might not be as much when you are at the top and don't work directly with all of your employees.And that you may fall into the trap of thinking that the people you don't hear from much are the ones you can easily get rid of, when in fact they may be the most proactive, the ones who are actually getting things done instead of just talking about it.At the end of the day, this is just a friendly reminder: people are one of the company's most important assets, so don't undervalue them.#layoffs #meta #hiringfreeze #alphabet #peoplemanagement #share #linkedinconnections

Hiring Freeze in 2023, the cold winter in the labour market?Throughout this year, the labour market has seen lots of ups and downs. Some big companies, such as Meta and Carsome, were hiring on a massive scale earlier this year, due to the new normal after the pandemic. However, the good times did not last long as the global economy was weaker than expected. As a result, many companies gradually began to lay off workers on a large scale in the second half of this year. The latest is the job cuts from Meta, which has been making a lot of noise recently. According to The Wall Street Journal, "many thousands of employees" are expected to be impacted. Indeed, it's happened, Meta has announced their job cuts number recently, 11000 employees in total.But this workforce disaster shows no sign of stopping and is about to enter another cold winter: Hiring Freeze. Hit by an expected global recession in 2023, many companies have already announced hiring freezes to control costs, which are expected to last until the end of 2023. The industry that bears the brunt is technology, including Uber, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and more. It could be a cold winter in the labor market; it could also be a reshuffle of the top talent in the market.What do you think? Will you choose to change jobs in this hiring winter?#jobmajestic #hiringfreeze #labormarket #careertrends

I have talked about this several times, and this is now a fact: tech companies who went into hyper growth during the pandemic thought such growth would continue after the pandemic.They gave for granted that consumption habits had changed forever (or would even continue to move in their favor).But they were so wrong. The question is: how could they be so wrong? What indicators did they see that showed them that we, the people, the consumers, would not go back to (more or less) "normal" after the pandemic was over?#techlayoffs are not a consequence of the current recession (IMHO, the recession has just been the trigger). #Techlayoffs, #hiringfreeze and the such are a consequence of bad planning, bad forecasting and overoptimism by such tech companies.PS. And Meta's layoffs may also be due to a too early (and badly planned) entry into the metaverse by Mark Zuckerberg

I always find that Q4 is when a lot of companies are coming to the end of their budgets and not really in the growth phase of hiring, but I want to dig deeper and be more accurate with a poll!It's no secret that there has been some lay-offs recently in the biotech space, which means there is talent around, but perhaps not the right roles available in the market to fill. I'd like to know your thoughts in the comments and your companies situation by voting in the poll below ⬇ #biotech #hiring #like #talent #growth #poll #marketresearch #industryinsights #vacancies #recruitment #hiringfreeze #howcanihelp

New from me and Ellen Thomas: Oracle employees say a new wave of hiring restrictions is cratering already low morale, and many worry another round of mass layoffs is looming. "Leadership refuses to step in and they refuse to hire more people and invest in talent. They aren't doing enough to talk about the elephant in the room, so a lot of teams are losing a lot of talented engineers," an Oracle engineer told Insider. #oracle #hiringfreeze #layoffs Read more Business Insider: https://lnkd.in/e86Q-7n5

When there are tech layoffs and/or hiring freezes across the market, people presume tech recruitment gets easier for those who are still hiring…In my opinion, it actually makes hiring tech talent EVEN harder. People tend to be less likely to change jobs in unstable markets, instead prioritising “security”!If you’re scaling, I predict 2023 will be the toughest year yet for Tech Hiring, so look after your Talent Team as you’re likely going to need them more than ever!#layoffs #hiringfreeze #tech #recruitment #hiring #talent #talentacquisition

Meta laying off 11,000 people right before the holidays is crummy news, and sadly I believe there will be more tech layoffs before Thanksgiving.One piece of advice for people who are starting a job search:Don't endlessly scroll LinkedIn Jobs -- timebox internet-based job searching to 1hr per day. Job board scrolling is everyone's go-to, but it's a huge time-suck and has a low hit rate.Landing a job is not a numbers game. It's a storytelling game.Instead, use your free time for reflection:(1) Write down what you learned (soft and hard skills) and how you grew (professionally) in this last role. (2) Establish an authentic strategic reason for wanting a new job. Get specific. Being able to articulate how you're now smarter, faster, stronger, and better will make you stand out in a crowded talent market. 💪Telling your future employer how this new role furthers your big career goals seals the deal.  🚀Do it!I've coached 100s of tech job searchers over the last 2 years, and 93% of them landed jobs at top-tier tech companies.I'm working on a set of accessible digital courses to extend my reach beyond 1:1 coaching and share my proven job search and career pivot systems more broadly.The first course is my system to prepare for and ace any first-round interview. This post is just the tip of the iceberg. 🧊👇 Comment below if you have other tips for acing first-round interviews -OR- 👇 Say "I'm in" if you're on a tech job search and want FREE pre-launch access to the course.#layoffs #meta #jobsearching #jobsearch #interviewpreparation #interviewprep #opentowork #interviews #recession #hiringfreeze #faanghiring

You can freeze hiring, but the work you need to do won't go away.

According to the Fed, the labor market is “too tight” and the 0.75% rate hike is one of the tools used to increase unemployment which may contribute to the impending recession. (Increasing cost of goods and services + decreasing discretionary spending). The Fed also announced that it expects rate hikes in each of the six meetings left for the year.Employers, does this news impact your current hiring plans? Do you perceive the rate hike as a signal to re-evaluate hiring plans possibly resulting in more layoffs and hiring freezes? Or is it business as usual?Job seekers, this may make your job hunt harder since companies may need to reallocate capital from new hiring plans to support the raising cost of current operations and to deal with the higher cost of borrowing capital used for expansion. #hiring #jobseekers #business #jobhunt #ratehikes #fed #labormarket #employment #talentacquisition #hiringfreeze #layoffs #jobmarket #jobs #recession #economy #macroeconomic

We've got two schools of thought in workplace management running in contradiction. One school of thought in corporate management calls for standard work hours, and the other school of thought wants to be known for its long hours of work, beyond what was stipulated. Increasingly I'm hearing about companies that are instituting mandatory overtime because they are entering a crucial period for the enterprise, and advocating to employees how it is an all-hands-on-deck situation. On the other hand, making longer work days mandatory implements a DNA in the organization of morose and mundane functionality which will flat-out impact efficiency and morale.#work #hiring #workculture #corporatehiring #hiringfreeze #hr #corporategovernance #management

"Meta laying off 11000 employees" "Companies extending hiring freeze"This has been the talk of the town and its disheartening to see thousands of people lose their jobs and more than that, lakhs not being able to land one due to changing company scenarios and economic downturn. However, the truth is, there's only a limited something you can about such situations. Thus, its important that we as a community build our resilient mindset and prepare for such situations by helping ourselves and each other out.Now talking about hiring freeze, here are some things we can do until the hiring freeze bubble breaks:1. Strengthen your professional relations as much as possible. They are going to always help you in the long run. 2. If you are already working in a company, seek as many leadership opportunities as possible to showcase your skills that will help you go up the ladder. Show courage and motivation, even in such uncertain times. 3. Help the people around you in any manner you can be it through referrals or spreading the word. It is important we grow together and not succeed will stunting someone else's growth. 4. Times are uncertain. It is important to be optimistic. Figure out the next plan of action and chalk out the available options. Seek support if needed. 5. Lastly, just because there is an economic downturn or a hiring freeze, do not stop applying. Financially stable companies keep the loop of hiring going at a different paces no matter what the economic situation. Submit your resume, showcase relevant skills and experiences, and when a position becomes vacant, it will definitely open doors for you. It is definitely not easy. But in the end, it will be worth it. #hiring #leadership #community #people #jobs #growth #opportunities #layoffs #metalayoff #mindset #resume #help #hiringfreeze Picture credits: USA Today

This is one of my favorite quotes and one I try to live by daily: “I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” - Maya AngelouAs a #recruiter and former #careercoach I have worked with thousands of job seekers and the one thing I always say to them is that my goal is to make their job or internship search as positive of an experience as possible. #jobsearching is stressful, overwhelming, and anxiety ridden. Add on #layoffs, #rescinded offers or a #hiringfreeze and that just increases that anxiety and stress times a million.There isn't a lot we can control in these situations, but one thing you can ALWAYS control is how you show up and make people feel. Are you showing empathy? Are you being honest/transparent? Are you being kind and giving grace? Are you remembering that we are all human? I encourage everyone to think about how you are making others feel during these times.Recruiters - how are you making your candidates feel when your hiring is uncertain?Leaders/Managers - how are you making your teams feel in times of uncertainty or when you have to deliver bad news?Candidates - how are you making recruiters or peers feel as you navigate your job or internship search?You also never know who you may need in the future -- a job or internship can be temporary whereas relationships can last a lifetime. How do you want people remembering the way you made them feel?#recruiter #universityrecruiting #foodforthought

An important tip for people who has experience of 2-3 years do not go for 200-300 percent of hikes, try to join companies in which they are doing client round(service based) otherwise there are many companies like Publicis Sapient  where they will keep you on bench. No one will be doing meeting with you, you will be end up on bench for 2-3 months and they will fire you in the end.I have heard from people after firing more than 500+ people these companies are hiring aggressively don't blindly trust them.#layoffs #javaprogramming #hiringfreeze

In the UK, the 2023 unemployment rate was being revised to 4.5 per cent, up from 4.1 forecast in FebruaryUnemployment rate expectations for 2023 are now higher than they were a few months ago also in New Zealand, Australia and Canada as interest rates rise and recessionary risks increases.The unemployment rates forecasts are revised up for all the markets tracked by Consensus Economics, including South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan.#inflation #unemployment #interestrates #hiring#hiringfreeze #jobmarket#techjobs https://lnkd.in/dEKccZNA

Layoffs impacts not only the people who were laid off. It also impacts ⭕ The dependent family members. If each has on an average 4 dependents then impact is already 4X.⭕ Regular fear among people whose performance was not up to mark but still not bad.⭕ Regular fear among people whose projects are not a priority project or kind of experimental.⭕ Regular fear among people recently got hired.⭕ New graduates under pressure getting a job.⭕ The worst impacted are the people having higher salaries.⭕ And even worse and the first to be impacted are the recruiters. I think so because layoffs means certainly a hiring freeze.Do comment if you see any more impacts due to layoffs. Current situation is terribly bad and seems going to be even worse.Hoping for better days soon.#layoffs #recruiters #layoffsandjobreductions #hiringfreeze #slowdown

Since the summer, Apple has touted its "deliberate" decisions about investment and hiring, including on its most recent quarterly earnings call last week. But three sources with close knowledge of conversations at the company told Insider it has paused almost all hiring.Staff across divisions, the sources said, have been told the company won't be onboarding new hires for a number of months, possibly through the end of the company's fiscal year, which is September 2023.#apple #hiringfreeze #tech #theunicorps #investment #hiring

"Meta implements a hiring freeze"The Facebook parent company is also reportedly cutting budgets.CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday informed employees during a weekly meeting that the tech giant would be pausing hiring. He said budgets for most teams would be cut, with some potential ways teams could adjust, including not replacing workers who leave or transferring employees elsewhere in the company, according to the outlet. "Our plan is to steadily reduce headcount growth over the next year," Zuckerberg said then. "Many teams are going to shrink so we can shift energy to other areas, and I wanted to give our leaders the ability to decide within their teams where to double down, where to backfill attrition and where to restructure teams while minimizing thrash to the long-term initiatives."https://lnkd.in/d7ZA7tiTPlatform: Fox Business NetworkAuthor: Aislinn Murphy#technews #techjobs #meta #facebook #hiringfreeze #bigtech #siliconvalley #tech #hiring

The #BigTechs are getting ready to fire or place a hiring freeze.5 Western Big Techs have collectively lost $700 billion market cap in the last five days, and they're planning to hire fewer people than they did before the Great Recession.That's right: these companies are laying off thousands of workers, despite revenues that continue to rise—and they're doing it all while keeping their profits high.It's enough to make anyone wonder about what's going on behind the scenes at these companies. And now we know: they're cutting jobs so that they can spend more on marketing, without feeling any significant pain from it...#recession #gafam #hiringfreeze

Tech hiring has had a rocky year. I decided to look at a sample of 150k tech candidates at Exponent to see where people applied in 2022 and where they're focusing in 2023. 🖥️ Hiring freezes and layoffs have reduced candidate interest in FAANG/MAANG companies in 2022🪙 Financial services like Stripe and Coinbase saw significant layoffs and restructuring, while other FinTech saw little movement and even some growth.📈 Some startups are accelerating hiring but Big Tech remains cautious.#hiring #tech #jobsearch #hiringfreeze #layoffs

#layoffs is a common word on LinkedIn now.Be it Meta, Twitter, Unacademy, udaan.com, Blinkit, Ola or others, people are getting fired or are forced to resign despite the efforts they have put into the growth of the company.There are a lot of senior employees in such a state.Going through LinkedIn, people are continuously talking about and helping laid-off employees.What about #hiringfreeze in companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce, Apple and lots of tech giants?Could we do something for the freshers who are affected because of the hiring freeze?Freshers are not able to apply for companies, their applications are getting rejected even after tests, interviews are getting postponed/cancelled, offers/joinings are delayed and the worst.. Offers getting revoked.This is for 2022 and 2023 graduates only.I will personally review and help the top 10 deserving candidates by sending their resumes/applications to my friends and connected recruiters.While hiring details will be shared with all the other candidates who applied.Any Recruiters, Hiring managers, CEOs, CTOs or Talent Acquisitions who are hiring freshers can DM me or comment (with the requirements).(note: A DM might help you get cream)Please help escalate to a better situation for the deserving freshers.Google form for 2022/23 grads and in the comment.Riddhi Dutta Raj Vikramaditya Love Babbar Nishant Chahar Sanket Singh Mohammad F. #hiring #freshersjobs #sde #mentorship #careers #india #startups #job #softwareengineerjobs #offcampus #recruiters #talentacquisition

What not to do this Q4...In a climate where cost of living and inflation rates are rife, DE&I is not a luxury. It’s a must do. Before you try to cancel our statement, take the time to read our reasoning in the shape of 7 reasons (one for every day of the week🙂) you should continue to invest in DE&I initiatives and efforts:1️⃣ In a climate where both your customers and potential new employees care about how diverse and inclusive you are, you simply can’t afford not to be - 80% of workers say a company's inclusion efforts are an important factor when choosing a company2️⃣ Toxic workplace culture and lack of diversity are amongst the top reasons for people leaving workplaces in the last 2 years so you’re guaranteed to lose valuable talent unless you do more and do it better - 1/3 of people in the UK have quit their jobs in the last year because of toxic workplace culture  + 75% would leave their company for one that values diversity more3️⃣ As a result, losing diverse talent would only make it harder to hire new talent from underrepresented communities when they can’t see anyone looking like them In your business - only 15%of tech workforce in the UK is from Black, Asian and minority ethnic background and only 26% identifies as women4️⃣ In a climate in which most companies are having hiring freezes and cutting hiring budgets, can you afford to lose members of your team and not be able to hire replacements. Most companies that I speak to would tell you how overwhelming stretched their employees are5️⃣ Inflation will come and go but the need for change remains and is here to stay so not moving forward = falling behind your competitors and losing your competitive edge - Diverse companies are 70% more likely to capture new markets with additional 38% being able to make a better assessment of consumer interest and demand6️⃣ Experts predict that by 2020, millennials will make up 35% of the global workforce with Gen Z making up 24%. That equates to more than half the entire workforce population! Gen Z is set to be the most racially and ethically diverse generation and so it's not surprise that they're not only demanding diversity, equity and inclusion but rather real tangible social justice for all7️⃣ 50% of employees say their companies already need to do better and that’s before you decided to cut your budgets.Need we say more?!#diversity #equity #inclusion #diversityinclusion #dei #diversityequityandinclusion #crisismanagement #recessionproof #hiringfreeze #talentacquisition

"Worries about slowdowns, such as Amazon’s recently announced hiring freeze for retail corporate workers, may temper workers’ confidence about how quickly they could find a new role.

How to navigate these difficult times when #layoffs, #hiringfreeze,  #burnout are all over?By letting go with grace. My first job was at Hewlett Packard Enterprise a company that gave me 4 years of immense growth, my first years training people, leading a team, having my own projects, and the first massive #layoff I was a part of due to the company moving operations to a different country. We were shocked, confused. It's been 8 years since then. My reaction was to hold on to what I had gained: #experience and #people. I now work at Clevertech and for that, I had to let go of A LOT. But this is what I got on the way:Agustín Rios Vergara: We met 2011 at HP. Last week he went to pick up the lease for my new house. Also signed it. He's THE friend. Natalia Urfer: My Manager at #hp. Taught me what #leadership is, took me everywhere, allowed me to get involved in whatever I wanted to pursue, gave me #validation , and encouraged all the curiosity and drive I had in me. Zero BS.Ludmila Venanzoni: I got my flight back to Argentina to get there on her birthday day as a surprise (she found out already). That's how close we are. We met working at a Real Estate/Legal firm together while in law school. We're each other's #person in the world. Paula I.: We had the same role YEARS ago in a company we stayed for a short time, we've been friends for a LONG one, almost died in a rafting accident, travel together all over, to Santorini last time ✈️She has the key to my place.Mauro Mathias Marconetto: We used to share how our dates went! I got the front-row seat to see him fall in love, get married, have his beautiful first boy (for whom I bought a whale twice his size), and now told me his beautiful wife and him are expecting the 2nd one.💜Brigitte R.: This amazing woman was my protégé and I am incredibly proud of her. We got to move to Europe at the same time and parted different ways (but didn't really). I used to wake up and go to bed with a thousand audios from her. Being her leader gave me more than it gave her. She taught me what drive really is.Daniel Gonzalo Garay: PM at one of the companies that made me grow the most and where I loved the 100 tech guys I had to run after to get them to do stuff (or stop doing it 🙄). He made my job impossible and also made me laugh every single day, got me food, helped me move to my apartment, hung my curtains, took me to pick up my kitten for the first time, and allowed me to have fun with his beautiful kids, who I never got to beat at videogames.Ing. Gustavo C.: Director of the same company above.Also signed the lease for my flat with me. Tough guy with the sweetest heart also showing real leadership.And that #vulnerability is a superpower for leaders, both ends. I have let go of #jobs and my country. I got to keep them.It's not easy but it's room for growth, as trees let go of their leaves in Autumn. Your #energy is critical. Invest it. Don't waste it.

Lots of us feel panicked & disheartened as the additional layoffs are announced each day, but the reality is that the climate for job seekers has been excruciating for all of 2022. After a decade into my career, I never experienced this level of disregard for candidates’ humanity — from interviewers, recruiters, prospective employers, hiring managers — I think many of us anticipated the opposite after the collective experience of 2020. Of course it’s true that we’re owed nothing in this world. But the lesson of 2022 has been an internal one. We are the most important thing & the greatest priority in our own lives. Many of our processes are broken… the way we interview. The way we treat each other in general, but in this realm specifically. The ghosting. The god complexes. The refusal to pay an appropriate salary for talent. The lack of clarity. The gaslighting. The false sense of urgency. The not caring about the time of others. The disregard for mental health. My heart goes out to all the people trying to stay optimistic, looking for work, looking for their dream jobs, doing everything in their power to create positive change, for themselves & for their families. I know how hard it is to keep believing in that. Today was one of the discouraging days where it’s hard to see the light of it all, but I know that every day after this will continue to present opportunities because that’s how it works. The future still has the capacity for hope.All my love,B #layoffs #hiringfreeze #opentowork #jobsearch #hiring

Over the last few months, I have been in a tough situation. After 200+ applications, countless interviews, 5+ offers in 2021 (Microsoft, Meta, etc), I eventually accepted an offer from Twitter in December of 2021 excited to start in August.But in June 2022, Twitter rescinded my acceptance as a Software Engineer 1 because it was “not critical enough for business priorities” months after I initially signed the offer letter. A Twitter recruiter scheduled a call to let me know this unfortunate news as soon as they knew about it, which I do appreciate. Even before I got the call, I was nervous due to the reports of the Twitter acquisition and my anxiety eventually became my reality.I totally understand that business priorities change and that difficult decisions need to be made. It just really hurt to be let go before starting my first ever job so long after I signed.If you’re #hiring for a full-time new grad #software engineering role, know of such a position, or could give me a referral of any kind, please let me know!I have interned in software roles at Facebook, ServiceNow, Kimberly-Clark and other companies over the past few years and am graduating from Georgia Tech in December of 2022.I’d really appreciate anyone commenting and reacting to this post for broader reach, thank you!#twitter #layoff #hiringfreeze #softwareengineering #newgrad #jobopportunity

❄️ ❄️ Czy grozi nam hiring freeze w IT❓❄️ ❄️ Na całym świecie obserwujemy pewne objawy kryzysu gospodarczego. Giganci rynku IT (Google, Microsoft, Apple, Intel, Amazon) weryfikują swoje zapotrzebowanie na nowych pracowników. Czy ten trend się utrzyma❓ Idąc za aktualnymi danymi, w pierwszej połowie 2022 roku w Polsce pojawiło się o 97% więcej ogłoszeń na stanowiska specjalistyczne w branży IT, w odniesieniu do pierwszej połowy roku poprzedniego. Mówimy tu nie tylko o stricte technicznych pozycjach, ale też ofertach w zakresie managementu. Największym zainteresowaniem kandydatów cieszyły się oferty w kategoriach:📍testowania oprogramowania,📍programowania w Javascript,📍programowania w Java,📍programowania w Pythonie.Największe zaś potrzeby pracodawców widoczne są w kategoriach:📍DevOps,📍testowanie,📍Java,📍Javascript,📍PHP.Wydaje się więc, że póki co nie możemy narzekać na brak ofert, szczególnie dla specjalistów z kilkuletnim doświadczeniem. Za potrzebami pracodawców idzie też zwiększanie stawek. Pozycja midów i seniorów jest tutaj również ugruntowana. Dla nich wzrost stawek był dość zauważalny – o około 25 % w stosunku do poprzedniego roku. Rosnąca inflacja zdaje się wyprzedzać podwyżki, aczkolwiek wzrost wynagrodzeń w IT i tak jest znaczący. Osobiście obserwuję niewielkie spowolnienie, widoczne zwłaszcza w kontekście zainteresowania niektórymi ofertami, natomiast nie w samej ilości ogłoszeń. Jak wygląda w Waszej firmie zapotrzebowanie na nowych pracowników❓Czy może wręcz przeciwnie – firmy ograniczają zatrudnienie❓  #zarobki #2022 #hiringfreeze 👉🏼 Źródła:🔍 raport JustJoinIT za 2021 rok🔍 https://linkd.pl/2p7r4

One chart – still – does not look like the rest.In the six months leading up to prior recessions, we typically see initial unemployment claims rise as people get laid off and file for unemployment benefits, and at the same time we see continued claims rise in lock step as people continue to file for those benefits as they struggle to find a new job. So far, however, the dynamic remains very different even as concerns over the potential for a recession have risen. Initial claims are higher than they were six months ago, but continued claims have trended lower.And it’s not hard to see why.Unlike in the lead up to prior recessions, many companies are still hiring and struggling to fill openings. That means those who have been laid off are still finding opportunities to get back to work. The big question in the months ahead is if this trend is durable enough to keep the labor market in a decent position and to help us avoid a hard landing.Even as the demand for workers is softening, the latest Federal Reserve Beige Book – which is an anecdotal account of business conditions around the country – highlights that labor shortages and the need to hire are likely going to be with us for some time. Some anecdotes:“Asked about operating challenges, a Minnesota manufacturer commented, “If I could check the labor availability box twice, I would.” ~ Minneapolis“Leisure & hospitality firms reported a marked pickup in hiring, and businesses in wholesale trade, information, and professional & business services reported that they continued to hire, on net. Firms in almost all industry sectors plan to add staff in the months ahead.” ~ New York“Overall, most firms still describe hiring and retention as a top concern. Most firms – 90 percent of manufacturing and 83 percent of nonmanufacturing – reported labor supply as constraining business operations to some extent in the third quarter of 2022. Several contacts noted firms were hesitant to lay off employees, given the difficulty they have experienced hiring workers in recent years” ~Philadelphia#economics #economy #unemployment #employment #hr #hiring #laborshortage #layoffs #hiringfreeze #jobs #federalreserve #interestrates

Latest Office for National Statistics labour report shows real wages have dropped 2.6% and unemployment is up 3.6%. Glassdoor economist Lauren Thomas says of the situation:“As news of tech layoffs spreads, Glassdoor’s data shows that employees are increasingly anxious with discussion of #layoffs doubling and mentions of recession up tenfold from last October. #Hiring has also taken a hit, with mentions of hiring freezes up more than 450 percent. “However, this isn’t 2008. Unlike the Great Recession, the current shortage of workers is much more acute and even a potential recession would be unlikely to result in the same peak of unemployment as we saw then. There are reasons to be hopeful – vacancies are likely to remain higher and both redundancies and unemployment are lower than before the pandemic.”On twitter Lauren sums up the situation by saying "Overall, the labour market is definitely weakening, but it's still strong - contrary to a lot of our perceptions. It's always important to remember when reading about layoffs in the news that they usually represent a pretty small slice of what's happening in the broader market"#hiringfreeze #data #labourmarket

As we all know many IT companies including big MNCs like Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter etc are laid off their employees and still some more companies are in the process of firing the employees.During this recession time it is difficult to get new job quickly.At least government should provide unemployment benefits those IT employees who lost their job till they get new job.IT employees are one of the main contributors to direct tax in India.They have to pay tax for every penny they earn from their first month of work.But when they lost their job, they are not getting any help/benefit for the tax they paid.Countries like Norway, Belgium, Germany, France, Switzerland are providing unemployment benefits.Indian government has to think about it.Share your thoughts in the comment.#maang #layoff #microsoft #byjus #twitter #meta #twitterlayoffs #government #layoffsandjobreductions #recession #hiringfreeze

Since the summer, Apple has touted its "deliberate" decisions about investment and hiring, including on its most recent quarterly earnings call last week. But three sources with close knowledge of conversations at the company told Insider it has paused almost all hiring.Staff across divisions, the sources said, have been told the company won't be onboarding new hires for a number of months, possibly through the end of the company's fiscal year, which is September 2023.Read more here: ﻿https://lnkd.in/e5t4PJXy Story by Reed Alexander and Claire Atkinson.(Credit: Rachael Lupton/Insider, Thomas Trutschel/Getty Images, sekulicn/Getty Images)#apple #hiringfreeze #tech

Ever think about how a #hiringfreeze could be beneficial to #hiringmanagers, #contractors and #recruitment companies? 1. Although it can be more expensive, often times the speed at which you can hire a contractor is much faster than perm2. Without the #headcount to hire permanent, companies with #missioncritical projects have no choice but to use contractors 3. #ContractRecruitment is better for #staffingagencies in regards to predicting and forecasting revenue Especially in #USA and #Canada, our financial systems are set up pretty well for #ITprofessionals to work as #independantcontractors, and even more so now to work on flexible schedules, balancing multiple projects at once (not locked in for 40 hours per week on one project). If you have been working perm and have considered moving to contract please feel free to reach out to Stacey Yu and Barnabas Njoroge for some advice. If you're a #hiringmanager who's dealing with a hiring freeze going into 2023 and would like some insight on how to keep the ball rolling by using contract workers I'm happy to talk to you about how some of our more #successful clients are making it work.

We hear a lot about candidates not joining even after accepting a job offer. But what happens when the situation is reversed?Recently, we had a client contact us to recruit 10 developers. Our team got to work; profiles were shortlisted, interviews were conducted, and offer letters were issued to 10 candidates. But here’s a twist in the story.The company underwent some organizational changes only a few days before the onboarding was scheduled. Among many other hard decisions, they decided to freeze hiring.The offer letters to the 10 developers were revoked with immediate effect. Just imagine! 10 developers, who had resigned from their previous jobs, and were waiting to take up a new opportunity, were suddenly left jobless.While we dealt with the mess of helping the client inform the candidates about the offer letters being rescinded, the whole experience was quite unpleasant.I’m sure our client didn’t see the change coming. They didn’t expect to freeze hirings. But the bottom line is that 10 unsuspecting job candidates were left high and dry for no fault of theirs!It got me thinking - what’s the right thing for companies to do in this case?Just as we talk about how companies should responsibly handle layoffs, we also need to discuss how companies should responsibly manage offer revocations. What do you think is the right approach? Do you think companies need to take more responsibility and compensate the candidates in some way if they cannot fulfill their commitment to onboard? #responsiblebusiness #rescinded #badabusiness #hiringfreeze

Das Unternehmen hat intern einen Hiring Freeze ausgesprochen, kann also aktuell keine Mitarbeiter in Festanstellung einstellen.Der Fachbereich braucht dringend Unterstützung und hat Arbeitspakete geschnürt, die an einen Freelancer abgegeben werden sollen.Genau so einen Fall sehe ich bei meinen Kunden immer häufiger.Die Plattform Fiverr hat kürzlich eine US-weite Studie mit mehr als 1.000 Inhabern von Unternehmen unterschiedlichster Größe und Einkommen durchgeführt.Die Ergebnisse zeigen, wie diese Unternehmen mit steigenden Kosten, Inflation und einem potenziellen bzw. drohenden wirtschaftlichen Abschwung zurechtkommen.Eine Mehrheit (78 %) gibt an, dass sie in Zeiten wirtschaftlicher Unsicherheit eher auf Freiberufler zurückgreifen, um Lücken in ihrem Personalbestand zu schließen.Sei der Grund nun eine wirtschaftliche Unsicherheit oder eben, dass man aufgrund des Freezes „keine andere Wahl hat“ -> Der Trend geht ganz klar immer mehr in Richtung externem überbrückendem Support.Gerne unterstütze ich in so einem Fall und verbinde die Fachbereiche mit den notwendigen Ressourcen, damit diese ihre Projektziele trotz Einstellungsstopps erreichen.#hiringfreeze #freelancesupport

Hiring freezes and layoffs, it's the end of 2022 and many market watchers are predicting a recession in 2023.You can see many companies like Apple, Twitter, Facebook and Amazon have done hiring freezes and layoffs in last couple of weeks.It's no surprise that many marketing budgets will be limited during these challenging time.SEO is the best way to leverage marketing during a recession. Your in-house staff of SEO, content and dev, is the budget, if you want you can couple those efforts with a limited brand spending on paid, but SEO is the organic lifeblood that when done right, puts you in front of those who want your product and services.You're vetting traffic before it even gets to your site, not fishing by plastering flyers on the internet hoping for not only a click but a Don't conversion from said click. Don't spend money for traffic that way, let an SEO strategy guide your brand to greatness.#recession2023 #seoexpert #hiringfreeze #searchengineoptimization #organicmarketing #layoffs #organicgrowth #organicmarketing

Meta Platforms Inc. Laying off over 11,000 employees and cutting 13% of its workforce has recently made the news.While some like to call it a heavy sinking of cash into the metaverse, other valid reasons include a crumbling advertising market and high inflation numbers.What exactly led to this situation?Just like peer firms high on liquidity during the pandemic, Meta aggressively hired to meet the surge in social media usage by stuck-at-home customers. But the business suffers now, as advertisers and consumers pull the plug on spending as a result of soaring costs and rising interest rates in the U.S.Meta, once worth more than $1 trillion, is now valued at $256 billion after losing more than 70% of its value this year alone.Is Meta the only one facing the heat?High-flying startups with record valuations, huge hiring goals, and ambitious expansion plans are now announcing hiring slowdowns, freezes, and in some cases widespread layoffs. In May, Y Combinator sent an email to its portfolio founders warning them to “plan for the worst.” Some other notable firms that have laid off employees and adopted hiring freeze include,PaypalRobinhoodNetflixTeslaCoinbaseTwitterTikTokShopifyOLASnapCompanies with a Hiring Freeze,MicrosoftNvidiaUberSalesforceIntelSpotifyGoogleEvery time there is a bit of a recession or the markets take a downturn, that is an opportunity for people to also reassess their lives.#business #meta #facebook #hiringfreeze #layoffs #interestrates #inflation #techcompanies #metaverse #recession #opportunity #startups #advertising #like

I am grateful for the support of my friends and colleagues and the generosity of my LinkedIn network 🙌. A few thoughts to share:- Looking back, the layoff has freed me to pursue greater opportunities without the guilt of quitting and abandoning friends and colleagues. - Tech jobs such as #productmanagement are still in high demand, despite the #layoffs and #hiringfreeze we hear about these days. A sneak peek: I’ll be hiring soon. - Leverage your LinkedIn network. All my interviews are a result of my previous LinkedIn post. Posting can be intimidating, but it really works. That’s for today. I’ll share more soon. If you have recently been laid off or looking for a job, feel free to reach out. I am happy to either 1) share what I learned or 2) see if there might be a fit in my next company. Happy Monday!

Layoffs and hiring freezes are being announced by a seemingly endless stream of companies and startups these days. Large numbers of layoffs were reported this month by many big tech giants, and fewer people are being hired. Businesses across industries are freaking out because of the current "hiring freeze" trend.Since nobody knows what will happen next, this might be quite frightening and stressful for veteran professionals and newcomers alike.

It is hard not to notice the recent layoff trend. Life is full of surprises. Though as negative as they sometimes seem, like these sudden layoffs, with an open mentality and strong faith, they can turn out to be the initiation of some new and more promising opportunities. For those impacted by the Meta and Twitter layoffs, I'd like to provide help with all but limited capacity. Nreal - a technology company focusing on Augmented Reality - is rapidly growing, and multiple Sales/Marketing/Public Relations/Product Management/Business Development/Designing roles are available in the US and Beijing, so feel free to reach out at ylli@nreal.ai!https://www.nreal.ai/#Nreal #layoffs #meta #metalayoff #metanews #Twitter #TwitterLayoffs #layoffs #twitterlayoffs #twitter  #downsizing  #OpenToWork  #recession #augmentedreality #recession #HiringFreeze #LinkedIn #Jobs #Hiring #Openings

My dear network! This is a call to all recruiters, talent acquisition specialists, partners, managers, sourcers, talent ambassadors and anyone else who usually sits on the “hiring side of the table”.   Since the last few months the #hiringfreeze ´s and #layoffs have been spreading around the globe almost with the speed of light - resulting in thousands of people losing their jobs and struggling with finding new ones. As professional talent scouts and people connectors - we, TA folks, know that getting hired might sometimes be quite challenging. Especially now, where the companies are slowing down their hiring efforts. However, the great thing is - with our expertise, we as community experts can help. Here is how we can help: Share in your network that you are open to help people who have been affected by the layoffs. Once they start reaching out to you, here are a few ways how you can support them based on your knowledge/experience and time available: 1) Review the CV/LinkedIn profile and make recommendations on what to improve2) Coach and practice the interviews with them3) Advise and consult on the compensation and negotiation best practices     These three steps of the #hiring process are crucial ones, hence - helping at least with one of them will have a tremendous impact on the candidates´ success. Let's help together to get hired in these tough times! :)                        Looking for help?

The big tech hiring freee is here and it's going to hurt. What does this mean if you're trying to get a job?Pulling sources from The Pragmatic Engineer, the predictions are that Meta, Microsoft, and Google are all pulling back significantly on hiring. Microsoft: “Our sequential headcount growth from Q1 to Q2 will be minimal.”Google: “Our Q4 headcount additions will be significantly lower than Q3 (10K people hired in Q3.)”Meta: “We expect hiring to slow dramatically and to hold headcount roughly flat next year relative to current levels.”Well there is a silver lining:One is that good news AI and ML seems to be the one ‘safe place’ to get hired across Big Tech. This means that AI engineers, ML engineers and data researchers, as well as related positions in AI, will be the best routes into these companies! However these positions are generally more senior as well. We've also seen another up-tick in the rise of layoffs according to Layoffs.fyi in October. Do you guys think the hiring slowdown is going to be a long term trend or will it re-bound by Q1 of next year? #hiringfreeze #layoffs #bigtech #microsoft #meta #google

By now it’s not a secret that many companies are experiencing massive hiring freezes/hiring slowdowns. Unfortunately my contract-to-hire position at Amazon was impacted by the hiring freeze, and I am now on the job market looking for my next opportunity.

Most ongoing layoffs have a similar theme. Companies that were hiring like crazy last year are now laying off employees, freezing their hiring, and cutting costs heavily. They are forced to do that because costs have increased a lot but revenue has not increased proportionally. Staying lean now is a strong competitive advantage as never before. #tech  #layoffs #costcut #bigtech #hiringfreeze #stockmarket

Amazon will reportedly lay off 10,000 employees.“Amazon's upcoming job cuts will reportedly impact its corporate employees, specifically its retail division, human resources, and the team working on the company's devices.”“Considering that Amazon employs over 1.5 million people across the globe, 10,000 workers laid off may not seem like a significant percentage from the company's perspective. It amounts to about 0.7 percent of Amazon's employees.”The whole layoffs scene started with Oracle, then Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter and now Amazon. We knew this was going to be the case after the pandemic, which is combined with the economic downturn, but of course it feels so terrible when it all becomes the reality. https://lnkd.in/gfnFuVfJPlatform: Mashable Author: Amanda Yeo #bigtech #layoffs #amazon #economicdownturn #economiccrisis #hiringfreeze #technews #humanresources

My OpEd for BW Businessworld on the current #trendingtopic of ‘ #layoffs ‘.Rather our obsession with it. Hence I title it, as deceptively as our career expectations are … “ Layoffs (don’t) lie (ahead)…”My view is that layoffs are not a new or recent phenomenon. And it’s not the last time we hear of them either. https://lnkd.in/dwV8dFu6#layoffs #retrenchment #talent #hiringfreeze #firing #quit #HumanCapital #downsizing #Rightsizing Annurag Batra Noor Fathima Warsia #talentmanagement #businessdecisions

Despite geopolitical and financial challenges, global CEOs are more optimistic about growth prospects than earlier this year, according to KPMG's 2022 CEO Outlook.While 86% of the chief executives believe there will be a recession in the next 12 months, the majority of them are expecting it to be mild and short, the report has found. Hiring freezes and downsizing remain key themes amid the looming recession. Around 75% of the 1,300 CEOs surveyed have frozen hiring or intend to implement a freeze in the near future, while four out of five are considering downsizing. CEOs are also putting environmental, social and governance goals on the back burner, citing "economic uncertainty". Despite their increasing understanding of the importance of ESG to financial performance, half of the executives surveyed considered putting off their ESG efforts. A third of those surveyed had already done so.While hiring and ESG take a back seat, more than half of CEOs said they are investing in buying new technology, particularly cyber security, as fears of cyber-attacks rise amid geopolitical uncertainty. What are your thoughts on the perspectives of 1,325 global CEOs?

Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, is undergoing "quiet layoffs" through shifting performance expectations that could affect as much as 15% of the company's workforce, several employees told Insider. It told staff last week in a weekly Q&A with CEO Mark Zuckerberg that it was extending a hiring freeze that's been in place since May.If 15% of staffers were pushed out, Meta would shed roughly 12,000 workers."It might look like they are moving on, but the reality is they are being forced out," a person familiar with the company's hiring process said.Read the full story by Kali Hays here: ﻿https://lnkd.in/dEUh3qrK(Credit: Drew Angerer/Getty Images)#facebook #layoffs #hiringfreeze #markzuckerberg

BlackRock’s plans to freeze most hiring through the end of the year following a 16 percent decline in net income over the past year may be emulated elsewhere, according to Christopher Davis, Head of U.S. Fund Research at ISS MI, in comments to Ignites.When profit falls “sharply, the only way to preserve margins is to cut expenses, and layoffs — or at least allowing attrition — is often the fastest path back to higher profitability,” said Davis in a recent article.Read the full article by Sonya Swink here: https://lnkd.in/gDumSkcU.

寒冬进行时！苹果freeze，Meta血腥裁员……巨额遣散费、猛男护送成为最后的慰藉！美国一众科技巨头集体“扑街”在最近的财报周中，美国一众科技巨头集体“扑街”。先是互联网云巨头，亚马逊、微软、谷歌三大厂的最新季度净利润分别同比下降9%、14%、27%，股价大跌。其中，亚马逊当日股价一度下跌18%，市值蒸发超2000亿美元。然后是去年改名“Meta”、在全球吹起“元宇宙”风口的Meta净利润更是猛降52.2%至43.95亿美元，导致其在股市一天蒸发了856亿美元。苹果已冻结招聘至2023年9月为迎接可能的经济下行，苹果据报道已冻结几乎所有的招聘，直至本财年结束。媒体周三援引消息人士报道称，苹果各部门的员工已被告知，公司在未来几个月内不会招聘新员工，公司已“没有预算”来增加人手。冻结招聘主要影响苹果全职员工，持续时间可能要等本财年结束，即2023年9月。苹果在回复媒体的声明中表示，“苹果仍在继续招聘员工，但考虑到目前的经济环境，公司在某些业务领域采取了非常谨慎的做法。”由于经济前景不明、公司股价暴跌，包括Meta、特斯拉、Rivian、微软和亚马逊等科技巨头都在裁员。Meta血腥夜，仅是layoff第一波！本周三，Meta宣布血腥裁员，1.1万人消失在元宇宙中。11000人一夜被裁，这是Meta成立以来最大规模的裁员，也是2022年科技圈裁员潮里最血腥的一波。公司将裁员13%，并控制预算，缩小办公区，冻结招聘延长到2023年第一季度。大厂“劝退“员工的PIP机制在绩效考核季，最可怕的三个单词是什么？——Performance Improvement Plan！硅谷的大型科技公司中，往往存在着一套 PIP机制。这是一份正式的文书，manager会给你一项短期任务以考察你的个人能力。在这段时间，你会被manager密切关注，记得同他多多交流，及时交付任务，认真对待反馈。如果你没有在规定时间内完成PIP，那么通常情况下，你要和这家公司说拜拜了。但是值得注意的是，PIP的“职场”口碑不佳，这是个非常微妙的机制，为雇主提供合法解雇员工的“证据”，许多人把PIP等同于解雇通知。即使你完成了它，最后也可能被花式劝退。推荐信与遣散费被辞退后，很多讲究的大型科技公司，例如Google会对你的未来求职给予帮助，包括给予巨额遣散费，给你未来的雇主写一封出色的推荐信等。正常情况下，被辞退的人都不会开心的，但是公司对离职员工给予尊重，可以留下好印象，利于员工再次回来任职或推荐新人，同时也降低了公司在未来被起诉的风险。肌肉壮汉的护送"we are letting you go."一个小纸箱，一位肌肉壮汉，就这样静静的立在工位上……在被辞退后，门禁卡失效，登陆系统失败，公司保安会“护送”员工收拾完东西，将其送出公司。这听起来有些不近人情，不过该方法有效避免了被辞退的员工因为愤懑伤心，而伤害、影响到其他人。在硅谷，解雇与跳槽一样常见。被解雇并不丢人，只要不是重大过失，很多企业还是会接受各类优质人才的加入。#Meta #apple #Amazon #freeze #hiringfreeze #tech #libaedu #北美求职 #篱笆教育

后疫情和战争带来的不确定性使得全球经济疲软。加息、高通胀和能源危机共同导致了许多行业寒冬，不少北美知名社交媒体和科技公司都在裁员和放缓招聘速度。早先Meta和谷歌也都宣布过进入hiring freeze状态。8月中旬，继Meta、特斯拉、微软和亚马逊之后，科技巨头苹果也加入了裁员大军。 据crunchbase的统计显示，截止今年8月底，美国科技行业的合计裁员人数已经接近20万人。比如科技巨头亚麻，今年第二季度就已经裁员超过9万人。当时疫情期间亚麻因为需要加强仓库运行能力而扩招了几乎翻倍的员工，也在后疫情时代慢慢显现出疲软。推特则是解聘30%招聘团队的员工，meta则是缩减员工人数增量。就Snap而言，今年以来的财报一直显示出其营运困难的状态。今年第二季营收和利润双双下滑、远不及预期。这些业绩亏损一方面与战争带来的供应链中断、通胀以及利率上升等宏观环境有关，另一方面也与行业竞争有关。此外，根据报道显示，Apple关于隐私政策的变动，使得Snap精准定位广告的能力大大削弱，广告效果变得困难。 有消息称，Snap首席执行官Spiegel还停止了许多团队和项目的业务。之前花费2.13亿美元收购的Zenly，自制剧项目Snap Originals，小程序游戏Snap Games，飞行拍照机Pixy等业务的投资均处在暂停阶段。同时，Snap还进行了一系列重组，并调整业务重心。在公开信中，斯皮格表示目前内部已经完成2023年财务规划和重新排序流程，目前是在低增长情况下实现自由的现金流。 如此看来，Snap似乎进入了一个关键时间节点，此时所做的决策将会对Snap未来的发展起到关键作用。无论大环境如何，Snap想要持续的发展下去，技术人才都必不可少。Snap在一份投资者报告中，设定了短期、中期和长期的发展规划，Snap的长期目标，依然是引领AR市场.经历过本次裁员，Snap的团队规模仍然远超同期。重组是为了更好的应对挑战，确保公司的长远发展，这也正是我们所说的，为了更好的出发。尽管目前的经济形势依然严峻，裁员风潮仿佛从未停息，但是秋招市场还依然火热，先前宣布hiring freeze的科技大厂也纷纷解冻。就我们这些准职场人而言，始终应该保有的是对工作场景变化的适应力，修炼内功，以应对瞬息万变的外部世界，早日上岸。#hiringfreeze #snap #layoff #amzon #meta

It's striking to notice so many ongoing #layoffs in the tech industry. A considerable number of specialists and experts are now looking for new challenges. And I hope they will find a new place in no time.Here are a few tips for those who are affected by mass layoffs or struggling to find a job.1. Free guidance or assistance from 1000+ senior leaders and experts - The Mentoring Club gUG (https://lnkd.in/d4_ikgtw).You can also check adplist.org (https://adplist.org/). 2. Job opportunities - don't just search on job sites (e.g. Glassdoor, Indeed.com, Dice, AngelList, Just Join IT or LinkedIn) but also check tech companies' social media profiles and websites. It's sometimes easier to submit your CV directly. 3. Find and join communities - there are many open discussion groups for engineers, data scientists, UX/UI designers, product managers, project managers, testers, tech support, etc. You can find those societies on Slack, Discord, Mastodon, Facebook & LinkedIn groups. Just google it. Examples of global product managers' communities - The Product Stack, Product School, The Product Coalition, Product's Digest, GetToPm.com.   4. Be visible with your personal brand - update your social media profiles, summarize all your work accomplishments and achievements, reach out to your connections.And remember - no storm lasts forever. Even now many companies are actively recruiting new tech employees. #layoffs #layoffsandjobreductions #techcompany #techcommunity #workforce #reductions #jobcuts #hiringtech #hiringfreeze #mentoring

Are you seeking your next job? With the economic slowdown and hiring freezes, this might be a particularly tough market for #jobseekers.I personally have a good number of people reaching out to me weekly, seeking advice on how to search for their dream jobs, how to land on #productmanagement or more #technical roles, and how to think about their #careerpath.  I loved the thoughtful, tactical, and practical advice that Nancy Wang, the Director of Product & Engineering at Amazon Web Services (AWS), provided and thought to share it here for all the job seekers out there: 1) Develop expertise & learn skills -- Always invest in yourself to learn new skills. This is particularly critical for those who want to be in technology-driven roles and companies as technology is always evolving.   2) Build connections in the industry -- Finding a job has a lot to do with your network. LinkedIn survey showed 85% of all jobs are filled via networking. 3) Think broadly about your career -- be open and flexible. Even though Big Tech companies, which might have been your dream companies to land on, are going through a #hiringfreeze, there are still companies that are hiring. Be open, land on a role, and learn as much as you could.  Careers are not linear & you always need to be reinventing yourself. What I love about these 3 pieces of advice is that they could also be very well relevant & beneficial for anyone who's employed and may not be looking for a new role. #jobsearch #jobseakers #careerdevelopment #careergrowth #carreeradvice #getthejob #gethired #gethired2022 #hiringfreeze #upskillyourself #upskill #technicalskills Business Insider

A few months BACK, every time I refreshed my LinkedIn feed, someone was joining a new company or someone was posting job openings in pan India. And now, since the LAST couple of weeks, every time I refresh my feed, someone is being laid off or someone's offer is getting revoked due to bizarre reasons or someone's offer is being rescinded. If you have noticed it, you must realize that the tides are turning. Companies are putting breaks on their aggressive hiring and not only that, they are not even onboarding those they have released offer letters for. As experienced employees, we must be careful about our next course of action. We might see more such layoffs due to imminent recession. It is better to sit tight wherever we are and try to make the most out of it till things change. For freshers, I believe the best course of action at this point is to try to make the most out of the Campussing. If not that, joining some reputed training Institutes might be helpful. I hope we recover from this tough time with fewer casualties than the last time. Did you notice the change also? #recession #layoffs #job #jobmarket #hiringfreeze #experienced #freshers

here is no doubt the tech industry is facing turbulent times, and is laying off people across the board. Meta and Twitter are some of the most notable names that have announced layoffs. Amazon has also started trimming its workforce substantially. LinkedIn, another tech juggernaut based in US, has revealed its plans to deal with the slowdown in the tech industry.   A report by CNBC TV18 claims that LinkedIn is not planning any kind of layoffs for now. However, Ryan Roslansky, CEO of LinkedIn, said that there will be a hiring freeze across various verticals of the company.    Ryan Roslansky said, “We haven't announced ... any kind of layoffs. We have put ourselves inside of a hiring freeze right now for various parts of the company. But again, like every other leader, we're just continuing to navigate the global strategy that we need to keep the company going to create this platform.”..#twitter #meta #linkedin #ryanroslansky #hiringfreeze #layoff #globalstrategy #amazon #technologyupdates #technologysector #technews #news #newsupdates #technologynews #njbizedit

"Layoffs don't tell the whole story - only 10% of it" is an interesting and valuable article by  Nnamdi Iregbulem. Some points, such as the connection between the unemployment rate and the job finding rate, are known. The article, however, becomes really interesting when he explains and compares lay-offs (the media's main focus) and hiring freezes (the real performance indicator): "* Slowed hiring is the real sign of weakness and vulnerability in your competition* Even with no layoffs, your competitors could be in dire financial straits, necessitating a complete freeze in hiring* If you're well-capitalized, your biggest opportunity during a downturn isn't picking up people who were laid off (though you should definitely consider this) but rather hiring the people your competitors would have wanted but now can't due to hiring constraints"Thanks to Hung Lee and his Recruiting Brainfood newsletter for pointing me in the direction of this article. #recruiting #talentacquisition #hiringfreeze #layoffs #startup #scaleup #hiring

Lots of interesting insight in this report from KPMG. Of particular interest to me was the following: While, 39 percent of CEOs have already implemented a #hiringfreeze, and 46 percent are considering #downsizing their workforce over the next 6 months, senior executives feel markedly more confident about the resilience of the #economy over the next 6 months (73 percent) than they did in February (60 percent). It's assuring that these CEOs remain optimistic particularly as we continue to wade through novel macro-environmental times.

Lately, every tech company has been in news for some type of belt-tightening for optimisation of margins, amplifying the outlook on reduced demand due to the looming recession. Google shared the news on "hiring freeze" in multiple press conferences in and around Aug 2022 but used an angle of getting better productivity from current strength as the main anchor vs. cost-optimizations.  But a directionally opposite pattern was observed, with third quarter hiring for the search giant being 25%+ higher than in the second quarter. This same pattern was observed for Facebook and Microsoft.My take for google (might be applicable to others too) on this is as follows:1) Investor Relations Tactic: As all tech companies are taking a pessimistic stance on recession and observing a dip in margins; not following the herd and continuing as it is, would make investors worry about the frugality and pragmatism of the company, making them antsy.2) Back to Office Tactic: The company made big news in June-Aug when they made it mandatory back to the office for all staff, for 3 days to start with. There were many debates provoked by this news, but having followed with a piece of news like 'hiring freeze' would subtly signal the company's strong position on this mandate and create psychological reinforcement in employees.3) Swing of the Pendulum: As we come out of the period of the Great Resignation, it looks like now the pendulum is swinging in the other direction, where employers are getting back in the driver's seat. Days of excessive hiring and protectionistic behaviours towards talent might wind down.4) Value what you have: News like these also create psychological impressions on the value of what one has. Although debatable, but there have been studies proving that making something scarce makes it more valuable, so hearing about less net-new hiring and potential rumours around lay-offs could potentially make incumbents more mindful of what they have and its valueAnother influence of this high hiring growth is the race to access top talent that is getting let go from some of the world's most renowned tech brands.Thoughts?#hiring #google #microsoft #tech #talent #productivity #facebook #technology #recruitment #greatresignation #greatresults #layoffs #hiringfreeze #psychological #emotional #humanbehaviour

https://lnkd.in/eDniqXRH"Apple Inc. has paused hiring for many jobs outside of research and development, an escalation of an existing plan to reduce budgets heading into next year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The company took the step last month, ahead of a quarterly earnings report where it said that growth would slow in the holiday period. The pause generally doesn’t apply to teams working on future devices and long-term initiatives, but it affects some corporate functions and standard hardware and software engineering roles"Technology leaders understand that the R&D function is the core capability enabling future competitive positioning.

Hiring Freeze?By now you’ve probably read a dozen news articles about companies around the world implementing hiring freezes. From Google and Meta to Twitter and Tesla, it seems as though no organisation is immune to these current market conditions. As a startup you’re probably wondering whether you should implement hiring freezes yourself, but before you do that, let’s give it some more consideration.  A hiring freeze is when a company suddenly stops hiring new employees. They may still hire for positions deemed essential but non-essential roles will be put on hold for a period. This can be looked at from the perspective that it gives the business breathing room to consolidate and assess what is really needed, but mostly this is seen as a knee jerk reaction during periods of downturn. Overall, I would never suggest a companywide freeze but rather a more strategic departmental or geographical freeze.  A few thoughts from me:  🟡Don’t freeze your revenue generating roles. The problem here comes in defining a revenue generating role. Sales is the obvious, but what if you sell a product you cannot deliver as your product and development hires are not seen as revenue generating?🟡Don’t implement a companywide freeze. Can you pinpoint locations or teams that are not profitable or stagnant and target the freeze?🟡Freezes often lead to increased employee frustration and concern, those teams that are already understaffed will feel overworked with no support, there will be concerns around job security, which may lead to staff turnover in teams already running on minimal resources. Can your business afford this?🟡Hiring freeze may have long-term effects on your ability to hire new talent. Future candidates may see the company as risky, while your potentially damaged employer brand may encourage competitors to poach existing staff. Remember: replacing is always more costly than retention.🟡If you need to implement a complete freeze, manage this with as much openness and transparency as possible- Communicate the reasons to your team and try to ensure security for their current positions. 🟡Manage this with the market to minimise negative perceptions on your brand. #hiringfreeze

Every difficult situation is a blessing in disguise, we only realize it once all the puzzle pieces are put together. If it doesn't benefit you, it'll strengthen you.

A study recently carried out by KPMG shows the importance of keeping talent top of mind. More specifically, the need for companies to focus on their workforce's retention to avoid losing top-performers and assume more costs with finding other A-players.It also dives into the short-term emphasis created by the anticipated recession through #Hiring freezes and headcount reductions: 39 percent of CEOs have already implemented a #Hiring freeze, and 46 percent are considering downsizing their #Workforce over the next 6 months. These are critical moments and decisions for companies as the impact of who, how and why will have a serious impact on how they are able to weather the storm. I leverage extensive data from historical trends (accumulated by ADP's research division) to advise clients on best strategy forward and ensure they're equipped with the right resources to make the best decision.

Off-lately, we have seen a lot of layoffs across different companies. Layoffs are always hard but is this going to be halted or whats going to happen! In a recent report by KPMG survey, where The KPMG 2022 CEO Outlook asked more than 1,300 CEOs at the world’s largest businesses about their strategies and outlook. The survey included leaders from 11 key markets like Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Spain, UK and US. There has been some surprising stats to look for ---- 39% of CEOs have already implemented a hiring freeze while 46% are considering job cuts over the next 6 months. - Included 11 key industry sectors like asset management, automotive, banking, consumer and retail, energy, infrastructure, insurance, life sciences, manufacturing, technology, and telecommunications.- 58% of leaders expect a recession to be mild and short. More than 8 out of 10 anticipate a recession over the next 12 months, with more than half expecting it to be mild and short.The market is changing drastically & we all need to keep a close watch on whats happening across. Plan for the best & worst situations. Always have the backup of financials ready. Create great network around. Companies need to create more transparency with the employees communicating on future plans, strategies & what to look forward.Source: https://lnkd.in/gD_w82ii#india #future #industry #strategies #business #hiringfreeze

Reta kompanija stabdys samdą vien dėl to, nes kiti stabdo. Paprastai verslas elgiasi priešingai – vieniems stabdant, kiti šoka į trasą. O apie samdos stabdymą kompanijos paprastai nekalba ne tik viešai, bet net ir viduje tai nėra komunikuojama. Tad samdos apimtys yra daug svarbesnis rodiklis nei atleidimai. KAS MŪSŲ LAUKIA: Didžiausia rizika su kuria susiduriama ekonomikai traukiantis yra ne šokanti aukštyn tikimybė būti atleistam, bet mažėjanti galimybė susirasti naują darbą (samdos stabdymas). Tad nedarbo lygis yra tiesiogiai susijęs su naujų darbo vietų stygiumi, o ne su atleidimais. Kai Genius Sport atleido visus darbuotojus Lietuvoje, jie neturėjo bėdų susirasti naują darbo vietą (ir gal net rado geriau apmokamą ar tiesiog geresnį darbą). Dabar, rodos, tai bus vis sunkiau ir ypač jei norėsi susirasti „geresnį darbą“ – geriau apmokamą, geresnėje kompanijoje ir pan., darbuotojų derybinės galios silpnės. MANO MINČIŲ BURBULAS: Aš vis dar gauna nemažą kiekį recruiter‘ių darbo pasiūlymų, tad, bent kol kas, Lietuvoje įmonės samdo ir tam reikia naujų/papildomų atrankų žmonių. Nematau ir akivaizdžiai sumažėjusių darbo pasiūlymų kiekio (bent jau IT srity). Bet dar visa žiema prieš akis, ruošiamės ir laukiam.#hiringfreeze #layoffs #jobmarket

As I reflect on the last couple of years (especially 2020 with Covid) this year many of us as recruiters came in with a huge push entering 2021 with lots of energy and several companies taking off and booming with reqs and needing candidates. I'm sure most of us didn't expect to be where we are now and taken back from several companies laying off and having hiring freezes - but here we are. Having to be vulnerable and face our reality. This is my last week here at AWS as my team also has been affected by hiring freezes, sadly my last day will be this Friday. Not sure what the future holds but hopeful something turns around and a new opportunity comes knocking in my inboxes. But for now I'll be finishing up and wrapping up to close this chapter with professionalism and integrity as always have. If there are Hiring Managers or Account Managers looking to bring in a Senior level Recruiter (Tech or Non Tech) whether it be full-cycle or as a Client Lead please let me know as I will be in the job market. #openforwork #R4R #recruiter #layoffs #hiringfreeze #aws

Tech companies are continuing to announce hiring freezes through the end of the year, and teams are struggling to pick up the work left behind by unfulfilled roles. Hiring a consultant or freelancer could provide some relief without the need to open a new position.#hiringfreeze #consulting #freelance

Does remote-only work lead to fewer layoffs and hiring freezes? Staffing Industry Analysts shared research that found 87% of U.S. companies that are in-person are considering hiring freezes, while 78% of remote-only companies are considering the same. What do you think? #HiringFreeze #RemoteWork #WFH

A North African tech worker had packed his belongings and was ready to move to London for a "life-changing opportunity" at Meta when he received a call that abruptly stopped his plans. A Meta recruiter told him that his job offer had been cancelled. He was set to start work in three weeks.He said he was part of a group of engineers who had been admitted to Meta's Discover Production Engineering program, which the company describes as a 12-month program providing systems and software engineering training to people with non-traditional backgrounds that can lead to a full-time role for some participants. Meta declined to comment on how the company's hiring slowdown affects its Discover Production Engineering program. Credit: Samantha Delouya via Business Insider#hiring #business #opportunity #job #engineering #tech #london #recruiter #engineers #softwareengineering #meta #hiringfreeze

The constant fear of global recession, slow economic growth, red hot inflation, and the energy crises in Europe take a toll on several Tech Giants and force them to put the brakes on their hiring process. 𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐚 (formerly known as Facebook) is among one them.Recently, the company announced to freeze on the hiring process for all its major platforms including Facebook, Whatsapp & Instagram to trim its expenses and realign its priorities. He further added that some vacant positions will not be filled and some workers from other teams will be transferred to fill the vacant positions. Meta is not the first one that has taken this step, numerous tech companies including Google, Apple, & Microsoft have slowed or stopped hiring due to poor economic development but none of them used the phrase "Layoffs". If Meta's restructuring leads to layoffs, the company will be the first of the major tech firms to do so since the start of the economic crisis.#TechNews #HiringFreeze #TechCompanies #Meta #Facebook #Instagram #Whatsapp

How did I clear the Google interview?Here are some tips if you're going through the coding interview and I'll provide the link to the resources I used. I have gone through the Amazon onsite interview before (and failed it because I didn't prepare well and was all over the place for preparation) and I knew what to expect for the Google interview.I had a basic understanding of different data structures, but I needed a lot of practice.First I followed this video by Clement Mihailescu to find out the fundamentals required for a coding interview. Clement Mihailescu uploads mock interviews on YouTube as well, check out his channel for more.https://lnkd.in/euwvN-FRNext, I followed the DSA course by Kunal Kushwaha to strengthen my knowledge of DSA. Kunal is legit when he said, "Follow this course and you'll crack the interview". Here is the link to the playlist:https://lnkd.in/e8rUjEnENext, I completed the Blind 75 LeetCode problems, and some more. I followed Neetcode on YouTube if I needed help with the solution. Check out this website for problems and solutions:https://lnkd.in/eBxmy3kNhttps://lnkd.in/enMJp4wJThere are lots of other materials as well, but for me, these three channels worked out the best. These were my steps.1. First I watched the video by Clement for programming fundamentals.2. I went through the DSA course by Kunal.3. At the same time I was doing LeetCode Blind 75. Steps 2 and 3 were going side by side.4. After I finished the course, I watched multiple mock interviews conducted by Clement to be more familiar with the #FAANG interview.Although everything was going well at my end and was in the final "Team Matching" stage when the hiring freeze started and my application was on hold.Lastly, I'm still open and looking for a job. If you're actively hiring or know anyone who's hiring, please let me know.#GoogleInterview #hiringfreeze #openforopportunities #activelylooking

What not to do this Q4...In a climate where cost of living and inflation rates are rife, DE&I is not a luxury. It’s a must do. Before you try to cancel my statement, take the time to read my reasoning in the shape of 7 reasons (one for every day of the week🙂) you should continue to invest in DE&I initiatives and efforts:1️⃣ In a climate where both your customers and potential new employees care about how diverse and inclusive you are, you simply can’t afford not to be - 80% of workers say a company's inclusion efforts are an important factor when choosing a company2️⃣ Toxic workplace culture and lack of diversity are amongst the top reasons for people leaving workplaces in the last 2 years so you’re guaranteed to lose valuable talent unless you do more and do it better - 1/3 of people in the UK have quit their jobs in the last year because of toxic workplace culture  + 75% would leave their company for one that values diversity more3️⃣ As a result, losing diverse talent would only make it harder to hire new talent from underrepresented communities when they can’t see anyone looking like them In your business - only 15% of tech workforce in the UK is from Black, Asian and minority ethnic background and only 26% identifies as women4️⃣ In a climate in which most companies are having hiring freezes and cutting hiring budgets, can you afford to lose members of your team and not be able to hire replacements. Most companies that I speak to would tell you how overwhelming stretched their employees are5️⃣ Inflation will come and go but the need for change remains and is here to stay so not moving forward = falling behind your competitors and losing your competitive edge - Diverse companies are 70% more likely to capture new markets with additional 38% being able to make a better assessment of consumer interest and demand6️⃣ Experts predict that by 2020, millennials will make up 35% of the global workforce with Gen Z making up 24%. That equates to more than half the entire workforce population! Gen Z is set to be the most racially and ethically diverse generation and so it's not surprise that they're not only demanding diversity, equity and inclusion but rather real tangible social justice for all7️⃣ 50% of employees say their companies already need to do better and that’s before you decided to cut your budgets.Need I say more?!#diversity #equity #inclusion #diversityinclusion #dei #diversityequityandinclusion #crisismanagement #recessionproof #hiringfreeze #talentacquisition

北美求职：又又又Hiring Freeze 了？！不止亚麻，还有Meta！求职人：心情就像过山车亚麻官宣冻结！亚马逊公司将停止其核心零售部门的招聘到年底，成为最新一家因应对经济下行而暂停招聘的大型科技公司。此次冻结适用于亚马逊全球商店部门的企业职位，不会影响到仓储物流部门。今年3月至6月亚马逊的“自然减员”下，员工总数减少约10万人，创单季历史最高记录。亚马逊发言人Brad Glasser周二在声明中说，“亚马逊公司仍有大量职位开放招聘。我们有许多处于不同发展阶段的业务，我们会在各个节点不断调整每个业务领域的招聘策略。”不止亚麻，还有Meta！彭博社报道，周四Meta首席执行官扎克伯格在一次内部全员电话会议上宣布计划冻结招聘和重组公司内部的一些集团。华尔街日报上周报道，Meta计划在未来几个月里削减至少10%的开支，包括裁减人员。由于Meta试图将成本降至最低，公司所有团队的2023年预算都将“非常紧张”。负责人Goler在通知中说，Meta将不会自动填补职位空缺，公司也将暂停内部调动，以避免将人员填补到可能发生变化的职位。这次冻结招聘和以往又有什么不同呢？小伙伴们表示：“更严格的freeze，转组和bootcamp graduation全停”“现在是从里到外的freeze了”“周二刚刚面完，HR今天feedback说4个strong hire，但是本来明天的review meeting已经被取消了，但是feedback 6个月内valid，如果再往后才有HC的话可能要重新面。补充下，面的是E6的MLE role，听起来是所有级别都会freeze”让人听了不免恐慌，招聘冻结给求职大厂的伙伴确实带来了不少影响，入职大厂看来是越来越不容易了。不过，亚麻也还是有相关岗位放出的，不要气馁，感兴趣的小伙伴还是可以投一投。想了解更多大厂求职信息的也可以和篱笆上岸学长学姐进一步沟通呀！MLE面试重点大揭秘不少同学在问MLE岗如何拿到offer。小篱笆已经整理出来一份面试重点，快点码住！！MLE全称是machine learning engineer，一般称之为作为模型法工程师。先说说机器学习，以名企为例，他们喜欢以Case Study的方式出题，考察候选人的建模能力。有以下几个重点考察方面： 01、Coding一般大厂Coding是要考两轮，Leetcode刷题是最有效的准备方式，Coding能力要和SDE看齐，把leetcode做n刷，作为模型法工程师，你的coding的要求一定要过关。 02、ML Coding有能力手写最基本的算法，包括Kmeans，KNN，LG等等，肯定是不能出错的。准备的方法也很暴力，就是背下来。MLE对coding的要求很高，和SE没有区别，问到hard的难度，也是正常的。推荐一题多刷。相信篱笆的18小时课程对你的面试帮助会很大。 03、ML system design根据不同公司可以复习不同公司的prefer考点，ML问题：发现Regression的问题占大多数还有选择和分析metric定义目标函数是可以重点看的部分，比如，名企的重点是在recommendation + Ads～ 04、ML fundamental从简单的classification和linear regression算法，算法底层逻辑必须要到能flash的阶段再到深度学习，熟练细节，比如dropout和batch normalization～ 面试时一旦你提到一个模型, 面试官就会盯着模型追问。怎么选feature， 如何选model，不同model有什么区别......所以说，只有扎实地掌握了模型原理和概念，才能在这样的连环问中存活下来。 05、behaviour最后，一定不能忽视behaviour，很多同学忽略掉behavior都容易翻车，一定要把behavior练好。近年来越来越被重视的行为问题，很多同学表示毫无准备头绪。好在篱笆的实战课程就包含了相关课，有专业导师会亲自讲解各种常见的BQ问题和回答思路。有需求的同学欢迎咨询【篱笆教育】~面对更加严峻的就业形势，想要获得面试官青睐、从求职大军中脱颖而出，就要做好充足的准备！针对此次秋招，我们专门定制了免费求职训练！#coding #ml #engineer #Amazon #freeze #meta #BQ #hiringfreeze

Tuesday thoughts... 💭The tech market has been in the midst of a hiring spree since businesses began emerging from the pandemic. Candidates have been more open to moving, and so companies have been battling it out for the best talent.That could only last so long, however, and reports now suggest that hiring is starting to slow for the first time in a year.Now isn’t the time to panic, to halt your hiring, and to simply wait for smoother seas. Rather, it’s an opportunity, as we’ll see.Read our blog on why you shouldn't freeze your hiring ⛄https://lnkd.in/eKcYKXEJ#HiringFreeze #TechHiring #TechRecruitment
-----------------------------
Why are companies currently doing hiring freezes? On the surface it's based on economic issues, but underneath is a bubbling shift in many company's focus on what they need,  how they are going to reach their desired outcome and if this outcome will come from fresh hires or evolving with their current workforce. We are on the edge of a new frontier - a new style of work, a new focus on who can adapt rather than what degree they have on paper. The proof is in the pudding and not on the recipe card.More than ever, I believe the workforce have the power to and will need to be more entrepreneurial within their roles."Nowhere is the need for adaptive leadership more critical than when it comes to creating an agile workforce. The skill sets for jobs have changed 25% since 2015, and by 2027, this number is expected to double. Even if you aren’t changing your job, your job is changing on you. Employees and companies that succeed will be those that focus on the skills needed for roles and changing internally rather than solely relying on degrees and pedigree." - Ryan Roslansky, CEO LinkedIn____________________________________________________Follow David FitzGerald on LinkedIn to stay up to date on recruitment tips, career growth advice, job opportunities, and tech news: https://lnkd.in/gy38zin#growth #fow #futureofwork #layoffs #hiring #hiringfreeze #recruitment

How do you navigate job hunting during a hiring freeze? Or if you just got laid off?You have heard about the hiring freezes. I have also had a client (international student) just lose a high-paying NYC job for new grads due to a layoff.  In my student's case, our coaching relationship has brought stability to that situation. The student could bounce back and focus on finding the next job, and incur no loss of OPT grace period. Hiring freezes and layoffs: In your case, focus on the meeting of people. Don’t let these concepts become an actual freeze of your efforts. Now, despite the news of hiring freezes, you are still looking - that is great to hear. How is it going? Are you finding chances to meet with the firms that you'd most like to join?#hiringfreeze #layoff #layoffs #opt #h1b #jstuartbradley #coaching #newgrad (Photo: thoughts and prayers for those recovering from the recent storms.

In the past few months, dozens of startups and major tech companies have announced hiring freezes and other cost-cutting measures. But do companies really treat hiring freezes as absolute?The reality is that not all hiring freezes are created equal. Behind closed doors, hiring managers at financially stable companies are successfully lobbying for permission to fill strategically critical jobs. Companies still need spectacular candidates in vital arenas such as cybersecurity and cutting-edge research. Don’t believe the rumors and miss the chance to work for your dream company.

What a wild time in the job market. I've been in the recruiting industry for over 23 years and have never seen such confusing signals... Lots of open jobs, lots of layoffs, lots of hiring freezes - some happening publicly, some privately. And yet, lots of incredible people struggling to find work.PwC refers to what's happening as a "Labor market paradox". Agreed.This article includes data from studies that suggest the situation is not getting better soon. It's a tough time to be a jobseeker for sure. A tough time to be trying to hire those great jobseekers for the open roles. A tough time to be a leader without enough people to get great work done. And a tough time to be employed and taking on the work of 2 (or more!) to help hit deadlines.It's an IMPORTANT time to be clear about what you're looking for, and even more importantly, to err on the side of over-communication. Every human involved in this working world needs acknowledgement and respect. Hoping this market works itself out quickly, for everyone's sake.#jobmarket #hiringfreeze #layoffs

Slowing Job Growth Good News for Those Concerned About Inflation  "U.S. employers added 263,000 new jobs in September, down from 315,000 new jobs created in August, marking the 21st straight month of job growth, but coming in under economists' forecasts, according to the latest employment report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).It's the lowest monthly increase in jobs since April 2021, and that's good news for inflation watchers, as a slowdown in hiring as well as muted wage growth should soften the pressure on decades-high inflation roiling the economy. Deceleration is what the Federal Reserve is looking for as a sign of progress being made in its efforts to tamp down inflation."#MorrisCountySHRM #nj #SHRM #hiringfreeze #hr #hrhiring #talentaquisition #humanresources #humanresourcesprofessional #hiring #hiring2022 #hrnews #jobs #inflation

How Companies Can Tackle The Gender Burnout Gap "The latest Gallup State of the Global Workplace: 2022 Report finds employee stress at an all-time high. The report states that almost half of the world's workers felt the burden of stress; however, working women in the United States and Canada were among the most stressed employees globally. As working women continue to undertake the majority of domestic and childcare responsibilities, they experience burnout and exhaustion at a higher rate than men. This gender burnout gap exists because most workplaces do not create cultures that support women in managing work-life integration."https://buff.ly/3EPv9Bw  #MorrisCountySHRM #nj #SHRM #hiringfreeze #hr #hrhiring #talentaquisition #humanresources #humanresourcesprofessional #hiring #hiring2022 #hrnews #womeintheworkplace #burnout #worklifeandwomen #worklife

Why CEOs Are Turning to a Data-Driven Hiring Process "One of the most recent developments in the relationship between business and tech is the progression into HR and the hiring process. Over the last few years, we’ve seen a shift in priorities, with CEOs from across the globe taking note of this movement. Currently, 62% of CEOs have stated that artificial intelligence is now the core of talent transformation.Across the whole hiring process and even into workplace training, technology is now a driving factor of change. In this article, we’ll dive into the world of data-driven HR, demonstrating how every moment of contact between a potential employee and a business is streamlined by the presence of modern technology."#MorrisCountySHRM #nj #SHRM #hiringfreeze #hr #hrhiring #talentaquisition #humanresources #humanresourcesprofessional #hiring #hiring2022 #hrnews #data #businessdataandhiring #hiringprocess #hrtech #technology

What if there is no faucet in your kitchen? Will you cook? How long are you willing to put up with the circumstance and make it work?I had a leaking faucet in my kitchen and the cabinet under the sink got wet. It only took 2 days for the restoration service to dry things out but the kitchen hasn’t been put back yet. It has been three weeks. Maybe another three weeks? I started to make simpler meals and still find myself constantly walking from the kitchen to my bathroom to use water. (25 steps each way!) This makes me think of the struggle of some of my coaching clients. Between hiring freezes and people quitting, resources are lacking but the same level of delivery is expected from the top. Maybe we should invite these top leaders to my kitchen and see how fast they can make a full dinner. ??#leadership #resources #hiringfreeze #expectationsmanagement #coaching #burnout

Big Tech's hiring freeze unlocks rich talent pool for U.S. startups "A survey of 581 executives, almost entirely from U.S. tech startups, showed that more than 40% of them boosted their hiring plans in the first half of 2022, according to hiring firm https://buff.ly/3BAjFfD and startup consultant MassChallenge.Companies are also shortening hiring times and offering higher pay packages to lock in candidates as they compete for talent in a tight labor market, recruiters said."https://buff.ly/3TeyiP0 #MorrisCountySHRM #nj #SHRM #hiringfreeze #hr #hrhiring #talentaquisition #humanresources #humanresourcesprofessional #hiring #hiring2022 #hrnews #BigTech #startups

Hi network! My time with Graphiant has come to an end (no surprise - it was a contract role). I’ve learned a lot during my time with the company & got to work with an amazing team of women in tech as well as some extremely talented engineers. I’m currently looking for roles as a #TechnicalSourcer or #Sourcer. I’m aware that a lot of companies in the #techindustry are currently on a #hiringfreeze and it’s been difficult to get any leads over the last month so I would greatly appreciate any referrals or connections!For anyone else who has been impacted by the hiring freeze in the tech world or has experienced layoffs, we’re in this together! Happy to connect and lean on each other for support during this tough time.#opentowork #openfornewopportunities

Hot take of the morning:Contract UX work is the equivalent of adjuncting in academia. It is so depressing to see the big companies announce hiring freezes or slow-downs as recruiters continue to bombard me with DMs and phone calls about "amazing" contract "opportunities." We all know this translates into billionaires saving money by replacing stable job opportunities with precarious positions that don't have benefits. This is like replacing tenured professors who retire with adjunct positions instead of comparably stable tenure-track positions.It's bleak. The grass is not always greener on the other side. The same bottom-line that is eroding the quality and morale within higher education also drives the decisions in industry staffing. These decisions are not human-centered in the slightest, despite all the talk about empathy in  UX.I'd challenge my readers to change my mind, but I'm sure you all agree. Because you also have to buy food and pay for shelter in capitalism. #ux #hiring #jobs #work #job #contractwork #recruiters #contingentworkforce #adjunct #hiringfreeze #hiringslowdown #unemployment #exploitation

After a year of rapid expansion, many companies are responding to a potential recession by implementing a hiring freeze. While this can lead to disengagement if unaddressed, it can also be an opportunity to renew workplace culture through open communication, encouraging creativity, promoting internal growth, and prioritizing mental health. By focusing on these areas, companies can come out on the other side of a hiring freeze healthier and more resilient than ever: https://lnkd.in/g7MTWPkH#hiringfreeze #workplaceculture #HR

The tech market has been in the midst of a hiring spree since businesses began emerging from the pandemic.Businesses are weary of an impending recession and, having learned plenty of lessons from the recent past, want to do everything they can to protect themselves.If businesses want to weather the next storm, however strong it may be, they’ll need to take a much more rational approach.

Hello to my LinkedIn connections and community,As some of you may know, I am having a rather difficult time finding a job in the US due to my 1-year OPT visa status. So, desperate time calls for desperate measures, I need your help!I just obtained my #MBA from Boston University (#bu) with a focus on Strategy. I also have a bachelor's degree in Business Management with a concentration in Marketing from Purdue University (#purdue #boilerup).I am a candidate with previous work experience who is open to full-time, associate to mid-senior, #productmanagement / #projectmanagement / #consulting / #strategy / #marketing / #productmarketingmanagement opportunities in the #Seattle area. I am also interested in #remote positions, and will consider relocation if necessary. If your team is looking to invest in an asset, I am also interested in entry-level positions where I can prove my worth to you from scratch. As an international student, it would be ideal to have the opportunity to be offered an H1B lottery sponsorship after my OPT ends in 2023, although at this time I am looking for opportunities to gain work experience in the US.————————To be very honest, it hasn’t been very easy to establish my professional career here in the United States. I received an attractive offer after I graduated from Purdue, but my family insisted that I go back to Taiwan and finish my mandatory military service. While this minor step-back may have detoured my career plan, I contacted the company that I interned at and began working as a Manager of Marketing and Public Relations. In 2019, I was promoted within the same company to an Internal Strategy Consultant, where I developed and executed strategies in partnership with the CMO and COO for product repositioning, international market expansion, and operations optimization while scaling up operation capacity to accommodate a growing international clientele.I’m a firm believer that learning never ends. My career was growing rapidly in Taiwan, but I felt the need to pursue an MBA degree to better prepare me for a managerial position in the future. As a result, I once again packed up my life and traveled across the world all by myself during the pandemic and began my postgraduate education at BU.Unfortunately, the consequences of COVID went far beyond anyone’s expectation. The massive #layoffs and #hiringfreeze limited my chance to even begin my career here in the US. However, I am not giving up. I am optimistic that an exciting opportunity will arise, and everything will work out if I just remain positive.————————I am a highly motivated, self-starting and collaborative team player who is confident to add tremendous value to your team with my background, education, and experience.Thank you for your time and attention. I really appreciate it. Please comment/react to my post for more visibility!#career #work #opt #h1b #sponsorship #fulltime #future #international #hiring #opentowork

So many opinions around why #startups and experienced businesses fail and how they could've avoided #layoffs, #hiringfreeze, and other headline-worthy (?) steps necessary to not go into any more financial turmoils. Of particular interest is the debate that starts every time a VC-backed company reports shutting off its operations, or a major layoff streak. Many fellow founders surmise that it is poor utilisation of funding caused by haphazard and complacent planning about the company's future. What does this mean though? Is it referring to a failure to hire an optimal number of team members with the perfect foresight to take the company through rough times? Is it a critique of their product and its fit in the market? Or is it the VC's fault for not directing their portfolio businesses properly enough? Seeing companies go down under often make me question: Can flexibility in their hiring and work systems mitigate the threat that uncertain economic shocks pose? What if instead of renting trophy offices or only hiring teams from the local city's top university, founders spend more of their time and effort in honing a highly efficient and productive work culture and ethics that can be sustained even with remote and hybrid work? For the economic/econometric experts out there, is there a study on the effect of flexibility on total productivity, or on the binary outcome of a company's survival through recessions? #vc #venturecapital #venturefunding #airlift #celcius #founders #funding #flexibleworking #econometrics

Recessions aren’t a serious risk to executives. It is a serious risk to the newly or continuously unemployed. Executives will have enromous bonuses for shrinking their workforces.

Impending recession. Hiring freezes. Layoffs. Worker burnout. It’s an uncertain work landscape right now. Here are 3 tips for how HR can navigate these turbulent times.✅ Listen to employeesAlmost half of employees feel spread too thin. Nearly three-quarters say their companies don’t understand frustrations related to the talent shortage. A full two-thirds say they are generally burned out.Listen to these issues. Then take real, measurable, meaningful action to remedy them.✅ Ease policy changes with transparencyWhen times are tough, policy changes are sometimes necessary. What’s not necessary? A lack of transparency.Be open, honest, and up front as soon as possible about impending changes. This makes employees feel included and more bought into company culture.✅ Offer personalized solutions when possibleNo, it’s not feasible to give all employees exactly what they want all the time. However, you also shouldn’t offer blanket solutions.Gift certificates for performance might be great for some employees, but others would prefer extra sessions with a mental health expert or flexibility to accommodate care-giving duties.➡️ For more insight, check out the complete article from HR Dive: Human Resources and Workforce Management News: https://lnkd.in/gvGcRTpw#HR #humanresources #recession #layoffs #hiringfreeze

If you’re going through a #hiringfreeze, building your team from within might be the answer to navigating a tighter recruitment budget. In other words, your focus needs to shift to getting more from what you already have.This might look like investing time into your employees’ professional development, tapping into their skillsets to collaborate on pressing projects, or restructuring your workforce into one that is more productive given the resources you currently have.Investing time and energy in your team now will have a high ROI and will enable you to work together to crush business goals. 💥#EconomicDownturn #EconomicSlowdown #Recession #HiringFreeze #MarketTrends #HiringTrends #MassLayoffs #Layoffs #HR #HumanResources #Recruitment #GTA #Toronto #Vancouver #Ontario #BC
