#Layoffs?! You’re talking about layoffs?!! Maybe surprisingly, Orange County #unemployment is back to prepandemic levels.
-----------------------------
Private companies are well aware of this fact that govt has gave up regarding employment (due to surplus labour force in a overpopulated nation) and now they're the only player in the market. So we can do whatever f**k we want and if someone raises a question then get ready for layoffs. And layoffs mean more unemployment in the country. And govt remains silent to avoid such disaster.#unemployment

Summary of my weekHelped a lady who's partner died unexpectedly access bereavement support, understand that are thoughts & feelings are ok, helped her to manage finances and got £500 off her electricity bill. Helping her gain employment as an translator to help refugees.Supported another lady who has fled an abusive relationship get online, got her kids into a local school, sourced free uniforms, completed an entitlement calculation and helped her and her kids get what they are entitled to. She will soon be volunteering with a charity helping others with similar experiences.Listened to a young lad who has addictions and wants help but is worried about stigma and asking for help. Arranged a same day appointment with a recovery worker and helped him with first steps of gaining the right type of employment.Supported a lone parent who's wife passed away during covid. He's had zero help & support and is now looking forward to a part time job working from home. Spent the day with support organisations listening to their challenges and advising where I can including helping 3 organisations with grants.Took 3 people to cafes who have said they can not afford to make a hot drink at home as in poverty (all 3 enjoyed a hot drink and tostie)The reason I write this is because I am increasingly seeing and hearing terms like 'benefit scroungers' 'lazy people' 'benefits Britain' and this is not what I see or experience.None of the people I see want to be on benefits, the stigma is terrible. Most people unemployed and on benefits will gain employment.  #people #kindnessmatters #ukeconomy #autumnstatement #2022trends #unemployment #jobs People Hub Also..I paid off my final credit card bill which was used during my past addictions and now debt free (thanks to Christians Against Poverty)Rant over ✌️❤️😀

Τον τελευταίο καιρό ακούμε στον δημόσιο διάλογο κάποιες «επιτυχίες» της κυβερνήσεως για το πως διαχειρίστηκε την κατάσταση του έθνους. Αυτό το άρθρο θα επικεντρωθεί κυρίως σε δύο βασικά αφηγήματα της Νέας Δημοκρατίας, την μείωση της Ανεργίας και τα υψηλά επίπεδα ανάπτυξης που παρουσίασαν.
Για να μπορέσει ο αναγνώστης να ακολουθήσει την συλλογιστική πορεία πρέπει να είναι εξοικειωμένος με κάποιες βασικές έννοιες στα οικονομικά. Κάνω αναφορά στην περίφημη καμπύλη Philipps. Η εν λόγω καμπύλη είναι μια εμπειρική διαπίστωση της βραχυχρόνιας αρνητικής σχέσης μεταξύ πληθρισμού και ανεργίας (eg Solow, 1960). Δηλαδή, παρατηρήθηκε ότι σε περιόδους υψηλής ανεργίας υπάρχει χαμηλός πληθωρισμός και το αντίστροφο . Επειδή αυτή η θεωρία έχει αδυναμίες μακροχρόνια, πρέπει να οριστεί η μακροχρόνια περίοδος. Υπό την σκοπιά της μάκροοικονομικής , βρισκόμαστε στην μακροχρόνια περίοδο αν και μόνο αν η οικονομία παράγει στο δυνητικό της προϊόν . Η προσωπική κρίση του αρθρογράφου είναι πως δεν βρισκόμαστε ακόμη σε αυτή την περίοδο και άρα η καμπύλη Philipps ισχύει. Έτσι, είναι φανερό ότι η πτωτική τάση της ανεργίας (από το 17.6% στο 14.7%, source: Eurostat) οφείλεται στην ανοδική πορεία του πληθωρισμού και ελάχιστα στις αντικυκλικές πολιτικές της κυβερνήσεως. Άρα, σε περίοδο κανονικότητας η ανεργία θα επανέλθει δυναμικά στο προσκήνιο και η εκάστοτε κυβέρνηση πρέπει να το γνωρίζει.
Επίσης, ένα άλλο επίτευγμα της κυβέρνησης (σύμφωνα με τους υποστηρικτές της) είναι ο υψηλός πραγματικός  ρυθμός μεγέθυνσης της οικονομίας στο 8.3% (source: World Bank). Εκ πρώτης όψεως ακούγεται ελκυστικό στα αυτιά των καταναλωτών, αλλά η πραγματικότητα τούς διαψεύδει. Με άλλα λόγια για να εξετάσουμε αν είναι όντως είχαμε ανάπτυξη πρέπει να δούμε τι συνέβει το προηγούμενο έτος: την περίοδο της υγειονομικής κρίσης Να σημειωθεί ότι δεν εξετάζουμε αν όντως έφταιγε η κυβέρνηση για την ύφεση, αλλά για το πως ανακάμψαμε έπειτα αυτού του αρνητικού σοκ. Το προηγούμενο έτος λοιπόν είχαμε ύφεση 9% (source: World Bank). Σε απόλυτα μεγέθη είναι φανερό ότι όχι μόνο ανάπτυξη δεν είχαμε, αλλά και σε ύφεση βρεθήκαμε (0.7%). Επομένως, και στα δύο αφηγήματα της κυβέρνησης, οι αρμόδιοι υπουργοί της αποδείχτηκαν για ακόμε μια φορά και στον τομέα της οικονομίας, κατώτεροι των περιστάσεων. Για να μην τα ισοπεδώνουμε όλα, οι δείκτες για ανάπτυξη αυτό το έτος είναι ίσως η μόνη παρηγοριά μας.

Tech Layoff; dominos effect! #tech #unemployment #masslayoffs #recession2022
-----------------------------
How do we move from great resignation to what we might now term, a great layoff?  It is happening at such a wrong time.  Not that there is a good time to be laid off, but at a time people should be gradually winding down for the year and planning for the holidays with family and loved ones.  What an unpredictable space we all play.My warm thoughts to all that have been affected by these layoffs.  Please do take, it one day at a time.  Watch your mental health, and it is okay to reach out for help. #layoff, #mentalhealth #unemployment

How Long Did Your Most Recent Job Search in Higher Ed Last?#jobsearch #higheredjobs #highereducation #sapro #jobs #unemployment #underemployment #staffing The most fascinating part of this article to me is the point brought out by the first comment in the comments section about those persons not captured who abandoned the job search and simply departed the field. I have previously worked to support hundreds of professionals in higher education and the largest percentage of those folks were those who were searching for a year or more and or left the field behind. I was also one of those myself.

 It's easy. Enter your information below, and we'll quickly reach out to discuss
Recruiters and hiring managers sometimes fail to distinguish between firings and layoffs when perusing resumes, causing valuable candidates to slip through the cracks. With low unemployment the new norm, potential employers must be willing to dig deeper to understand exactly why an applicant left their previous job.

While companies may lay off employees to streamline processes or reorganize, that doesn’t mean those employees don’t have marketable skills that can be of value to a new employer. In fact, layoffs present a valuable opportunity for hiring entities as experienced candidates reenter the job market.

The tech industry seems to be in a recession. Although overall unemployment is still very low, just about every major tech company—including Amazon, Meta, Snap, Stripe, Coinbase, Twitter, Robinhood, and Intel—has announced double-digit percentage-point layoffs in the past few months. The stock valuations for many of these companies have fallen more than 50 percent in the past year.Watching this surge of mass layoffs in big tech companies, plus the lurid chaos unfolding at Twitter over the past few weeks and the spectacular ongoing implosion of crypto, the big question on my mind is: Why is it all happening at once?The simple, and possibly simplified, answer to this question is: It’s the interest rates, stupid.#tech #layoffs #recession #chaos #unemployment #interestrates #meta #twitter

During this time of my unemployment, I have been craving some more real-time human interaction, so I was thinking of creating a Slack account where I can generate a land for "misfit employees," if you will (holiday spirit here, heh), converse, collaborate, suggest opportunities and generally support each other during these tumultuous times in the tech space. Would anyone even be interested before I invest time into it? I may just do it anyway and chat with myself. 🤣#SlackCommunity #Unemployment #Converse #Collaborate #Opportunities #LinkedInCommunity

The #unemployment rate in Silicon Valley held firm at 2.1% in October, identical to the rate in September. Overall employment in the region increased by nearly 1,500 workers, while the number of unemployed people decreased by just over 600. The total labor force in Silicon Valley increased by almost 2,200 from mid-September to mid-October, erasing most of the drop from the previous one-month period. The total labor force is now 14,500 below the previous high in February 2020. The labor force now includes approximately 89,600 more individuals than the pandemic low of 1.42 million in May 2021. #jobs #siliconvalley https://lnkd.in/gAqN79X9

As a closing part of her lecture at XIME Bangalore during the national seminar on Strategies for accelerating job opportunities, Mrs. Anuradha Prasad, Founder and CEO at Indian Leaders of Social Services, pointed out three opportunities for the young PGDM graduates and other students. 1. Fund raising: In India fund raising is looked down upon. Asoka University was founded through crowd funding worth Rs.3000 crores. Akshaya Patra which feeds 2 million children daily raises funds using multipronged approach. US universities have overtaken European universities because of the generous funds available through fund raising initiatives.2. Social Entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurship can be promoted and supported for solving social issues. There are many venture capitalists willing to fund social entrepreneurship. Several accelerators and incubators are also promoting Social Entrepreneurship.3. CSR: The impact of CSR activities on the society and the economy are enormous. The CSR initiatives through various foundations and corporate divisions also opens up wonderful opportunities for young students. McKinney research recently revealed that 92 percent of employees believe that it is important for their organizations to have a purpose.  72 percent believe that purpose is more important than profits. Also, employees believe that purpose driven leaders are not just important they are immense necessity.#ilss #ximembangalore #nationalseminar #acceleratingjobopportunities #unemployment #ngos #fundraising #csr #socialentrepreneurship

The recession is coming along with this winter!!!!!I can feel the chills from the cold economic wind with the tonnes of lay off going in the market. Meta and amazon laying more than 10,000 employees, and Twitter is an ongoing wave. The world feels like a mess with concerns like unemployment, rising competition, bankruptcy (FTX was a real thing, but still unbelievable),  poverty, and whatnot.All we can do is keep our surroundings warm by preparing for the future. The easiest way to go about it is increase your market value :        -> upskilling yourself,         -> learning more,         -> collaborating rather than competing,         -> adding value to your workspace,         -> helping others grow ( this will bring positivity & blessings in your life)        -> finding or creating opportunitiesLet us start today as PRECAUTION IS FAR BETTER THAN CURE, especially after going through the COVID WAVE.

Not surprising. Georgia is the No. 1 state for business and Atlanta is the best place to live in America - everyone wants to be in the Atlanta metro area.“They have raised pay for wage workers, added incentives for its salespeople and found themselves ghosted by job candidates in a market where good employees are hard to find and keep.But Georgia Furniture Mart still needs more workers for its 36-year-old, $51 million-a-year business, a locally owned, 160-employee operation that runs 14 trucks that make up to 120 deliveries a day, according to Justin Padden, the company’s director of sales and training.‘We are always hiring,’ he said. ‘Right now, with this labor pool, we try to talk to everyone and anyone we can.’The Norcross-based company illustrates the defiance of the Georgia economy, growing steadily this year despite higher interest rates, inflation and looming fears of recession.The state last month added 3,700 jobs, giving Georgia 163,900 more jobs than when the year began — stronger than any parallel, pre-pandemic stretch, Labor Commissioner Mark Butler said Thursday. ‘The rate of job creation still far exceeds those in the workforce looking for employment.’The state lists more than 165,000 open positions on its jobs site online, with the most listings in health care, retail and hospitality, Butler said.——While monthly data can be erratic, they can often offer clues to the economy’s trajectory. October’s job growth was slightly smaller than the average expansion in October. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate ticked up to 2.9% from 2.8% in September, but is near historic lows.”#Economy #EconomicGrowth #Job #Jobs #JobCreation #JobGrowth #Unemployment #UnemploymentRate #Georgia #PeachState

Recession risk is currently obscured by the high CPI readings. In the 1970s recessions it took several months of recession BEFORE unemployment began to rise. That is typical inflationary labor hoarding behavior, when real wages are negative and the economy is running at maximum end of cycle capacity. However, today's pundits always point to the strong jobs market as THE sign that the economy is doing well. This week's retail earnings are another widely ignored warning. As is the inversion of the yield curve, now at a 40 year high:#jobs #economy #retail #yieldcurve #Fed #unemployment #housing #tech #recession

Each day, when I login to social media, I see companies laying people off because of what’s happening in the economy.Transition, being let go, or showing up to work only to realize it’s your last day is no fun, so I interviewed my friend Cleon Cox III-DTM®-Networking Whisperer so he could share some ideas that will hopefully make the transition easier for some of you out there trying to figure out what’s next.Cleon facilitated a job seekers support group for over 30 years and has been very supportive of many people in transition during their careers. I hope you enjoy the episode as much as I did!https://lnkd.in/gpXHrt6Y#purposepodcast #layoffs #transition #unemployment #economy #careers #careerdevelopment #thecatalystway

Pacific Panel Cleaners LLC we have been proud to have been working for 13 years in this industry we made a commitment to keep my entire team paid during the pandemic and increased pay and promised to keep all health benefits- so the great state of Hawaii continues to thank the small business Just got this noticeHawaii SUTA Increase for 2023 As noted in the Honolulu Star Advertiser on November 8, 2022, the DLIR will likely be moving to Schedule G for State Unemployment (SUTA) taxes. Hawaii is currently on Schedule D. This would take the new business rate from 3.0% to 4.6%- a 42% increase. Please make sure your organization is budgeting accordingly for the state’s increase in this tax for all employers beginning on January 1, 2023. In the meantime, we continue to engage with the newly elected administration to advocate for relief on this unprecedented rate hike. We will continue to keep you posted as we learn more from the state.Isn't this awesome, I am not eligible for the employee retention tax credit because we didn't lose enough money since we kept working and now my rates went up again FYI we were below 1% prior to the pandemicYea small businesses cant wait to see what the Fed is going to do for my FUTA that had bumped up #hawaiibusiness #hawaiihatessmallbusiness #aee #HSEA #hawaii #hawaiilegislature #HawaiiCOC #hawaiisenate #BrianSchatz #taxes #hawaiitaxes #hawaiisolar #solarhawaii #unemployment

Hello ☺️ My name’s Sebastiana and I’m a student on the Masters of Applied Positive Psychology and Coaching Psychology programme at UEL. I believe that employment programmes aimed at reemploying individuals should involve a coaching and positive psychology perspective, to not only tackle crucial challenges, but to increase wellbeing, career self-efficacy and potentially job search behaviours which can lead to reemployemnt.To tackle this, I’m conducting a research study on the effects of Integrative Career Group Coaching and goal-based Positive Psychology Intervention on job seekers. If you are job seeker, aged 18+ , and would like to take part - please follow the link below. If you have any questions and wish to discuss things further please email U2212582@uel.ac.uk https://lnkd.in/e6NFQQ28Kindly share to family and friends who may benefit from this research. #employment #unemployment #jobseekers #research #coaching #career #jobsearch #wellbeing #positivepsychology #psychology #jobseeker #careercoaching #careercoach #share

I was let go on September 12th, stating "my services were not required anymore". I couldn't confirm this unless I had a written confirmation  which was received approximately 50 days later.Even though I had/have excellent reviews and recommendations all throughout my career from ALL my ex-managers (including being called "the best employee"), I was let go one fine day without prior notice and all of a sudden, stating that their strategies/priorities had changed. I wasn't even given a few minutes after the aforementioned meeting to collect the necessary immigration documents. So the last 50 days of the stay in the US, had been about finding every way I could to get my immigration related documents which my previous employer including director of human resources and the immigration team were not handing over to me. I am STILL not sure if they gave me all the documents after an immense mental struggle for the first 50 days of unemployment! Obviously, being in a state of mental breakdown for the first few days, the mental exhaustion in using every bit of energy to secure the required immigration documents, since collecting the paperwork was a priority for me, I had to exit before I could immerse myself completely in finding more jobs. Yes, being let go is never easy: additionally figuring out a shady trail of immigration related challenges because all the documents are stored in the company based portals, and having to exit the country where you have spent 11 years 3 months in 60days shows you the  true meaning of "worst of both worlds"! That being said, I ALWAYS try to NOT hold grudges, move on with my life and never look back and look at the better side of life - so I will use this time to actually figure out what I want to do with my life next. I still have authorization to work in the US till 2024, if anyone has any information or know of any suitable employment opportunities, please let me know. #immigration #layoffs #careers #unemployment #immigrantstories #h1bvisa #greencard

A reflection on the last week:I was not prepared to be joining the wave of November Tech Layoffs of 2022 but…who really does expect these things? Sadly, our entire company was laid off, and my time at my current company was cut short just as I was about to hit the one-year mark. I was devastated by this news, not just because I would have to seek something new, but because I thoroughly enjoyed working with such an opportunistic, creative, motivated, supportive group of visionaries. It takes me awhile to process things, so before thinking of what I should do “next”, I wanted to reflect on why I truly loved working at my current position.1.    Community– When I first started, I instantly noticed that everyone supported one another. There was no gossip, back-handed compliments, or aggression with any member of the company. We acknowledged and built on each other’s strengths and sought to maintain an environment that promoted growth.2.    Leadership –Each leader in the company was honest, approachable, and offered valuable mentorship. Doors were always open, and communication was ongoing and straightforward. I always felt like I could seek advice or offer up suggestions without anxiety or judgment.3.    Trust – I didn’t realize how valued I would feel when I simply was given a task and left to my own accord to complete the task. Micromanagement can be crippling and at MagnifiU I was free to create my own schedules and routines that allowed me to work at my best. I’ve never felt so productive and fulfilled while creating content.I know there are many instructional design jobs out there in the world, and I am certain I will find another one that is just right for me. However, “Dear, Next Future Employer…” please know that these are professional values that I find nonnegotiable. Being in the right environment made work not work, but a shared goal, in which I am proud to take part.  #techlayoffs #unemployment #opentowork #elearning #instructionaldesigner

Australia’s #unemployment rate fell to 3.4% in October, from 3.5% the month before, according to new data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.Our national unemployment rate is at its lowest level since 1974.However, there is some variation in economic conditions between the states:* ACT = 3.1% unemployment* NSW = 3.2%* Qld = 3.4%* Vic = 3.5%* WA = 3.5%* SA = 4.0%* NT = 4.0%* Tas = 4.2%

I was laid off early in my career, from my first professional newspaper job. The company brought in someone from unemployment to talk to us, he said "Being unemployed is a full-time job." This stuck with me, and every time I was out of work, I threw everything I had into the job search with the goal of getting a new job as soon as possible. The result: me taking jobs that weren't right for me. For everyone newly on the job market, enjoy the unemployment benefits, you earned them. Take some time to regroup, breathe, sleep in, go on long walks, and finish that cross stitch you started in the pandemic. Give yourself a break. Of course, that is if you can afford it. Capitalism being what it is means that sometimes getting any job that pays the bills is priority number one, but if you can... take your time. #work #job #jobsearch #rest #takeabreak #unemployment

I have been reading the Art of War and as an unemployed graduate I have decided to use it to see how I could possibly get a job in a country that has an enemy of an unemployment rate. This means war. Sun Tzu in Job Hunting: Part 1/13 1.     Plans need to be madeSo I guess for this to work I will need to establish what the enemy really is. I really want to move from the enemy being people like my fellow graduates, hiring managers or the president. The enemy is unemployment. Now that that’s out of the way I definitely need a plan. They don’t just pick names from a hat and hire right.2.     Plans need to be based on analysis of the conditions surrounding the battle This means I can’t just make plans without thinking of what is going on. They have to come from some sort of analysis. From the top of my head I am thinking lots of numbers of graduates each year, few companies hiring, 3.     Analysis should be made in comparison between you and your enemy.The analysis from the top of my head was pretty one sided. High numbers of graduates means that while the chances of me getting a job are low, hiring managers also have to deal with a large number of applications. While only few companies are hiring, maybe I am the one they are looking for.4.     Break common trends and methods of doing things when conditions are favourable.There are so many rules about getting employed. What cvs should look like and what I should do during interviews but I need to be on the look out for situations where breaking these rules will work in my favor. Infact I need more information about the companies I would like to get hired by.5.     All warfare is based on deceptionCan I really deceive unemployment? Maybe I shouldn’t be so obvious in my job hunting. I really am looking for a job but maybe I should focus more on other things so I do not look so desperate. What can I do so that they can look for me when I was really actually looking for them?6.     Things to analyse includea)     The Moral Law- (society, beliefs, stereotypes). Though people are not what I am battling against here, they play a major role in what I am trying to achieve. They are hiring managers, employers etc. I need to know how they feel about things and what they will most likely do. So because it is in comparison I would need to compare to my beliefs as well.b)    Heaven- (unforeseen events and things that can’t be controlled) c)     Earth-(conditions and obstacles)d)    The Commander; (driving force, motivation, reason for doing something) What drives a company. What drives me?e)    Method and discipline.(resources, how I do things, how things are done) What is a company’s hiring process? How do I think people get hired? Okay this is a lot and it is just the first chapter. From my analysis so far one thing is for certain, I have quite a bit of work to do. #artofwar #suntzu #grit #unemployment

This is one of the first steps you should take when you're impacted by a layoff. It's often overlooked or not talked about but it is something you should always try to use. Layoffs around this time of year are extra traumatic. So, please take advantage of this benefit in order to try to offset costs if you haven't received a lengthy or decent severance package. Also, please note, unemployment varies by state -- some states offer longer periods than others. For example: Florida is 12 weeks and California is 26 weeks.

£55B fiscal squeeze in the UKYesterday Jeremy Hunt told a sombre House of Commons that a massive fiscal consolidation of £30B of spending cuts and £25B in tax rises was needed to restore Britain’s credibility and tame inflation. Here are the key takeaways:- Windfall taxes on energy firms will be increased to 35% from its current rate of 25%. This is about to raise a combined total of more than £14bn next year and is projected to raise roughly £55bn by 2028.- Public spending will be limited to 1%, a huge reversal from previous guidance of 3.7%. Some £35bn in savings, by far the fiscal consolidation’s biggest component, will come from holding down public spending during the next parliament while freezing capital spending. However, this is scheduled for the years after an expected general election in 2024.- Top-tier 45% tax threshold will drop from £150,000 to  £125,140. “We are asking more from those who have more,” the chancellor said.- The National Living Wage (NLW) will rise to £10.42 from 1 April 2023, an increase of 92 pence or 9.7 per cent but the £12,300 tax-free allowance for capital gains tax is will halved to around £6,000.- UK’s GDP is predicted to shrink by 1.4% in 2023, inflation is set to be at 7.4% whilst the unemployment rate is predicted to tick to 4.9%. Hunt claimed that things will have to get worse before they improve.While former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s September ‘mini’ Budget was the largest tax-cutting plan for 50 years, Thursday’s statement was the biggest tax-raising effort for 30 years other than during the pandemic. British households are set for the steepest fall in living standards on record and the highest tax burden since the second world war after today’s statement. Despite that, there wasn’t any turmoil in gilts or gbp which should be considered a success.#fiscalpolicy #statement #tax #energy #success #spending #cuts #livingstandard #wages #inflation #unemployment #gdp #recession #economy #minimumwage #publicsector #budget #capital

Beware! You could be next! ☠️#Masslayoffs are the trend of the season with companies like Amazon, Twitter & Facebook Meta laying off thousands of employees.• Byju's- 12,000• Meta- 11,000• Amazon- 10,000• Twitter- 4,400It’s time that you get your finances in order! Here’s why:An emergency would never knock on your door. It would just smash through the window & leave you no time to prepare. 👊What we mean is precaution is better than cure. So, here’s everything you must know to be prepared for every emergency that comes your way. 👉 What is an #emergencyfund?As the name suggests, an Emergency fund acts as a lifesaver in case of any emergency. It is a readily available source of liquid funds that can be used in case of any financial problem.👉 Why should you have an Emergency Fund?Remember how the unemployment rate rose over 20% during the 2020 COVID phase? The wave of unemployment is back now! Therefore, it is always advisable to have an emergency fund to avoid such situations. 👉 How much money is required?The average time to find a new job is 3 months. Therefore, it is advisable to have at least 3 to 5  months’ expenses as your emergency fund. For Eg, if your monthly expenses are ₹50,000, you should have ₹2.5 lakh as an emergency fund. (Stay strong, friend! You can’t live paycheck to paycheck forever. 🥲)Now, this amount should be invested depending on the preferences. Ideally, you should divide the amount into long-term & short-term funds. • Long-Term Fund: We should use this fund for extensive emergencies like medical situations, natural calamities, or unemployment. This amount is not urgently needed; hence, it can be invested in slightly illiquid funds where the returns can be higher with minimum risk. Liquid funds can be a great option to earn interest on your money where you can withdraw the amount whenever require.• Short-Term Fund: This fund should be highly liquid. It should be immediately accessible in case of emergency. The best option is to keep this amount in cash at your home or in the savings bank. ('🐷+ 🪙' time!)Having an Emergency Fund is not an option, it's a necessity! Apart from this, there are several other parameters through which you can achieve financial freedom in your life. Idealising your portfolio to generate wealth and fight against all emergencies is not impossible! 🤩And guess what? You can count on Finology ONE to make it happen!

Observed this on a visit to one of the condominiums around Arabsa, Addis Ababa. It made me think of unemployment, and the saturated market. The youth is out on the street, fighting for every penny. The good part is its using all tools close to him to get his food.This and many condominium walls are used as a placement for ads. we are not new to ads on the streets but using my house, my home for an ad in a permanent manner like this one, Its a sad. This is reflective of many things. I cant blame the buisness, because it works. I am just wondering where did our standards go now? Is selling something, or marketing something invading others privacy, Does it have to be this way? #marketing #privacy #architecture #unemployment

Hello people hope you are doing great. Guys please don't trust Devante Davis and FST firm consulting and  IRED  investments llc which this guy is running. This person hired me as an account manager 2 weeks ago. I frequently asked for the appointment letter which he ignored multiple times. I tried to contact him now and then multiple times, he never replied. I asked him about work but never gave me an answer correctly just told your job is to get investors and was never offered and training and tools to do the task.He offered me to pay weekly, now second week is going to end on Friday and he haven't paid me for the first week even.I have 5 investors in line ready to invest and so I demanded 2 weeks salary. He not only denied me on giving my salary saying that I have done nothing to deserve a salary but also blocked me on all social media accounts so that I cannot disturb him. And now after posting this he is threatening me to file a defamation case against me.Guys again please don't trust this person. He is not trust worthy#toxicworkplace #devantedavis #unjust #workculture #unemployment #employeetreatment #employeedevelopment #unfairdismissal #treatment #training #development #appointment #employee

In the recent report from Statistics Canada, the findings were:- There were 1,005,700 vacancies at the beginning of May 2022, an increase of 42% compared to a year ago.- The vacancy rate was 5.8% compared to a 5.1% unemployment rate compared to a year ago.- Vacancies in accommodation and food services were the highest, with 161,000 openings.While vacancies are good news for job seekers, it suggests excess demand. As the demand for skilled workers increases in parallel with skills and labour shortages, employers of all sizes are struggling to attract and retain top talent. Looking to attract top talent?

Four years ago tonight I remember that I hardly slept. In previous weeks, in an attempt to maintain financial solvency for the company I worked, I’d already laid off more than 20 employees. I was the Chief Compliance & HR Officer for a company in the real estate valuation industry. This was my DREAM JOB until it wasn’t. That next day the company would be terminating everyone and closing. It was the Monday of Thanksgiving week. The timing was horrible and my heart was heavy. Those were hard days for me as a professional. I took the role personally & seriously. If you’ve ever been laid off and wondered if those making the tough business decisions care or take it seriously, I can assure you that I did. In fact to this day, it saddens me for all of those impacted.#compliance #business #realestate #unemployment #hr #job

"Why do companies lay off employees? Is it because of a bad business model? Overambitious planning of CEOs and founders? Cost-cutting to manage expenses? Or absolutely external reasons, like geopolitical tensions, and economic failures... Maybe it's about everything but my heart goes to those people who go through this pain!  Our lives are so dependent on our jobs that the majority of us can't see any alternative. I remember a dear friend of mine gave no reaction when he lost his job at a television media house. He was stunned and said, I have a home loan EMI ! Twitter, the social media portal that talks the most, fired 90 per cent of its staff from India and cut half of its global headcount. Stripe, America's biggest online payment start-up, fired 14 per cent of its staff. The largest e-commerce business in the world, Amazon also fired 10,000 people. Meta, the Facebook owner, fired 13 per cent of its people, and Chime let go 12 per cent of its employees. Online used car dealer Carvana laid off 2,500 employees, many of them over Zoom. Closer to home, many start-ups have laid off staff. The world's superpower, US has been witnessing a sharp increase in job losses. Despite notable job gains in health care, professional and technical services and manufacturing, the unemployment rate in October 2022 in the US rose to 3.7 per cent.  The total number of tech employees laid off so far this year in the US has hit 120,000, which is higher than the number of tech workers sacked during the Dot Com bubble in 2001.  Asia and other regions are also going through the same pain.   #jobloss #people #tech #business #founders #manufacturing #healthcare #media #unemployment #crisis

The most recent #unemployment figures published by the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics show that 33% of the Nigerian Labour force is unemployed. For context, 33% of Nigeria’s Labour force is 23.2 million, a number that is about the population of Taiwan and larger than many other countries. For a country with the seventh-largest population in the world, the unemployment record is distressing. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) defines an unemployed person as one who is ready, able, and willing to work but cannot find work. These rates are 6 times above the 4%-5% rates that economists consider as the ideal rate of unemployment for a healthy economy.So why is Nigeria’s #unemploymentrate so high? In this policy brief, we will analyse the national burden of unemployment, what the effects are and how can the country’s decision-makers solve this problem.You can't afford to miss this edition, here's the link to the brief. https://lnkd.in/dZZG8xW5#economy #work #unemployment

We all come across beggars almost daily in our lives. While we often wonder whether we should give them money or not, a more important question escapes us: why do so many beggars exist in our country in the first place? Many of us tend to think that most beggars are part of a syndicate that is run by an underground mafia, but such assumptions often have no grounds in evidence. Instead, problems of poverty, migration, and even religion lie at the heart of the begging problem. In this video, we discuss these factors in detail while also emphasizing what needs to be done to alleviate the problem.#beggars #india #explainervideo #sochbymohakmangal #begging #poverty #video #mafia #unemployment #disability #slums #homelessness

Thought of the day:There was a time where studying and obtaining a qualification was so important that you knew doors/job opportunities would open immediately after studiesToday, the chances of someone not having any qualification is better then you holding a DEGREEWhy? Economy has fallen, after COVID, a lot of businesses closed their doors and we are suffering the effects of UNEMPLOYMENTI know it was defistating knowing that your business just collapsed and you had no other choice but to stopMy point here is, there is a lot of GRADUATES out there seeking for employment, some being so desperate that they will even work without any pay, just to gain experienceI went to university straight after I matriculated, spend my free time doing holiday jobs here and there. Every vacancy requires 5 years and above, 2-3 years or above, just YEARS. There is graduate programs, very very rare, you apply for them but still unsuccesful, can there not be more? OR can't there be an institution or something you go to after studies in order to obtain experience? Just someting to know that your not lost after studiesWe need employment in order to gain that YEARS of experience. How will GRADUATES ever succeed if there is no options for us?#gradutes #unemployment #jobseekers

This past Wednesday marks 5 months of #unemployment. Since June 29th, I’ve reflected on how I got to this point, and with the help of self-help books & videos, meditation, and journaling, I now know that I arrived here because of shiny object syndrome in the form of money. What do I mean by this?I did not truly seek to have a long-term tenure at any given company after grad school; all I was after was the pay itself. And I took that pay for granted. Instead of maximizing my efforts and abilities, had less than stellar work ethic and my contracts/employment would end prematurely. At first, I was able to get away with finessing my way through multiple companies for a while. Then after my most recent position ended and my gravy train stopped, it was then I fully realized how much I hurt not only myself (financially), but hurt various recruiters who offered me these jobs and my colleagues who believed I could genuinely contribute to their organizations’ missions, values, and expectations. At best, I was just a bad employee who’s luck had run out. At worst, I felt like a fraud and a hypocrite.Many recruiters don’t like short stints at companies; I look like a flight risk and potential bad hire altogether. But I want to change your perception of me. I have learned my lesson and I am ready to be an employee that an employer would be proud of having on their team.So to all the recruiters I have reached out to or have accepted my connection requests, (thank you by the way), I ask that if you have any openings that may be a good fit, please do not hesitate to message email or call me directly.

What is unemployment insurance (UI) and how does it work?I went to lunch with a young professional who just got laid off. He didn’t know about unemployment insurance (UI). We discussed how it could help him and how to apply.With recent layoffs, I figured others may want to know more as well.WHAT IS UI?Unemployment Insurance is a state-level benefit paid for by employers and paid to those who are unemployed through no fault of their own. (Doesn’t apply if you quit. DOES apply if laid off, fired without cause, your hours have been reduced)HOW DOES IT WORK?When unemployed, you apply online at your state’s UI website. They determine your eligibility. You can receive a percentage of your regular pay up to a specific limit. (In Utah, it is $661 weekly.) UI benefits can be received for up to a certain number of weeks. (In Utah, it is 26 weeks.)  Each week, you apply on your state’s UI website for a weekly payment. You must show you are continuously looking for work to be eligible. (In Utah, you must prove you made 4 new contacts for full-time employment each week.)HOW DO I APPLY?✔️ Google: {Your state} unemployment insurance application✔️ Follow all steps on your state’s UI websiteSURPRISING FACTS: (Facts confirmed for Utah, but may apply in your state as well)✔️ UI benefits can be received for partial job loss (reduction in hours)✔️ UI benefits can still be received after job loss, then working part-time and earning up to 30% your previous pay✔️ UI benefits can still be received after moving out of state, but you must follow address change forms and still live in the USHR friends, any other info you’d share about UI benefits? Let’s help those needing support with this.#Unemployment #UI #Layoffs #Laidoff #HR

Australia’s #unemployment rate fell to 3.4% in October, from 3.5% the month before, according to new data from the #AustralianBureauOfStatistics. Our national unemployment rate is at its lowest level since 1974. However, there is some variation in #economic conditions between the states: * ACT = 3.1% unemployment* NSW = 3.2%* Qld = 3.4%* Vic = 3.5%* WA = 3.5%* SA = 4.0%* NT = 4.0%* Tas = 4.2%
-----------------------------
The net employment in Australia rose 32,200 in October from September when they fell a revised 3,800. That came as a surprise to many analysts who had looked for a gain of only 15,000.Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday showed net employment rose 32,200 in October from September when they fell a revised 3,800. That came as a surprise to many analysts who had looked for a gain of only 15,000.The jobless rate dipped to 3.4%, from 3.5%, again beating forecasts of a slight rise, while hours worked rebounded by a strong 2.3% as fewer people than normal took leave in the month.Full-time employment jumped 47,100, bringing total job gains for the 12 months to October to a massive 762,000.That would bring the total tightening since May to 300 basis points, easily the most aggressive in modern history.While policymakers still say there are more hikes to come, they have recently emphasized the amount already done and the length of time this will take to feed through to mortgages.The emphasis on keeping unemployment low has seen markets trim expectations for how far rates might go, with futures now implying a peak around 3.80% compared to over 4% a month ago.Much will depend on how labor costs develop, with data on Wednesday showing annual wage growth accelerated to a decade-high of 3.1% in the third quarter but remained well short of the 4%-plus levels that would threaten inflation.Longer-term visa holders rose by a net 17,000 in September alone, while almost 36,000 students arrived compared to virtually zero a year earlier when the COVID-19 pandemic had shut the borders. - Alaa Younes  #australian #mortages #jobless #jobs #job #COVID19 #unemployment

In our personal or professional life, we may associate negative experiences with our self-esteem or worthiness.She suggests 5 steps to help us deal with the feelings associated with shame:𝟭. 𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘀𝗵𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂.𝟮. 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘀𝗵𝗮𝗺𝗲.𝟯. 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗽𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝗱𝗱 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗹𝗼𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴-𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲.𝟰. 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗮𝗹.𝟱. 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀.June Tangney, a shame researcher at George Mason University, reminds us:  "𝙄𝙩’𝙨 𝙞𝙢𝙥𝙤𝙧𝙩𝙖𝙣𝙩 𝙩𝙤 𝙩𝙖𝙠𝙚 𝙖 𝙝𝙖𝙧𝙙 𝙡𝙤𝙤𝙠 𝙖𝙩 𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙚𝙡𝙛 — 𝙣𝙤𝙩 𝙤𝙣 𝙖 𝙙𝙖𝙞𝙡𝙮 𝙗𝙖𝙨𝙞𝙨, 𝙗𝙪𝙩 𝙖 𝙛𝙚𝙬 𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙞𝙣 𝙖 𝙡𝙞𝙛𝙚𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙚.” 𝙐𝙨𝙚 𝙨𝙝𝙖𝙢𝙚…𝙩𝙤 𝙥𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙪𝙚 𝙣𝙚𝙬 𝙘𝙤𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙚𝙨 𝙤𝙛 𝙖𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 — 𝙩𝙤 𝙘𝙤𝙣𝙨𝙞𝙙𝙚𝙧 𝙬𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙠𝙞𝙣𝙙 𝙤𝙛 𝙥𝙚𝙧𝙨𝙤𝙣 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙬𝙖𝙣𝙩 𝙩𝙤 𝙗𝙚 𝙞𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙬𝙤𝙧𝙡𝙙.The concept of “unjustified shame” is included in the article. This term was coined by Dr. marsha Linehan, the creator of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy.😩Unjustified shame is part of the emotional, psychological, and physiological response we may experience when losing one’s job or other events outside of our control. The same applies to rejections when jobseeking. We wonder what we missed.The massive layoffs taking place in the technology sector and other organizations are painful. I empathize with the range of emotions as one is suddenly uprooted and facing major change. 😖 Normal responses include anger, sadness, frustration, embarrassment, desperation, relief, fear – and, yes, - shame.Below are concepts from Dr. Linehan’s earlier published worksheets. Acknowledging your emotions, although difficult, means accepting that the situation and the negative emotions are not because of anything that you did or did not do.You are a person of value and contribution beyond your job title or employment status. 💔 So many of us have experienced this shame in our lives. This period of questioning and confusion is part of our shared humanity and the grief and loss of the past few years.❤️‍🩹 Give yourself time to mourn, to explore your feelings and emotions, reach out to a professional for support, allow time to heal, spend time with those who care for you, and commit to allowing self-compassion rather than self-judgment.You can access the full article "Free Yourself From Shame at Work" by Dr. Jenny Taitz here: https://lnkd.in/eHQ9tKus#psychology #layoffs #shame #support #mentalhealth #health #wellness #unemployment #job #therapy #research #change #emotionalintelligence #empathy

Miprofile took the entrepreneurs/affiliates/network leaders to Durban. The trip was all expenses paid that was from 14th to 18th November. Trainees/representatives were from Botswana, Lesotho and different provinces of South Africa. This was not a holiday, it was work. The daily schedule started very early (4:45am) we met at a specific point outside Blue Water hotel. We would go down the sea area start by inviting our God with prayer, share the word, read scripts, devotion, motivate sometimes we cried because it was intense and the spirit of God would take control.We would then go for a breakfast buffer. Then our training started at 9:00 then finished 4:00pm that time was for Miprofile and our CEO Frans Jooste.After that we were told that we can do as we please with our time but it was not easy because we still met to study or do revision of what was taught. On Thursday we closed the night with buffer super.Thank you to Miprofile LLC, thanks to our CEO Frans, to management and team, surely our affiliation skills and commitment won't be the same anymore.Ķeep planting the seed through entrepreneurs to change communities.

"Over 11-12 April 2022, intense rains hit the eastern coast of South Africa – causing floods and landslides across the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. More than 400 people died as a result of the floods, which also destroyed more than 12,000 houses and forced an estimated 40,000 people from their homes.The World Weather Attribution service finds that climate change doubled the likelihood of the event – from an event expected once every 40 years to once every 20. It adds that rainfall over the two-day period was 4-8% more intense than it would have been without climate change.".(Source: https://lnkd.in/ddA4bjRJ)..Contact us to find out how you too can assist EPF in reducing the high levels of unemployment ➡️ info@empirepartnerfoundation.org.https://lnkd.in/gZ-V6jx.#africa #climatecrisis  #climatechange #floods #rain  #sdgs #sdgs2030 #tech #agriculture #farming #southafrica #people #solutions #innovation #sustainability #impact #unemployment

Uncertainty Breeds Opportunity  So far reports of #layoffs and #hiringfreezes are on the rise and the number of people impacted in November is already exceeding the cuts we saw in September and then in October. Below is a snapshot of some of this month’s most notable announcements impacting more than 20,000 people, many of which are #recruiters and corporate #talentacquisition specialists. While we all know that these roles weren’t the only positions impacted, it does suggest what the near-term hiring climate could look like specially in the tech sector. Some reports suggest we’re through the worst of it, and others believe we could see deeper cuts coming in the 1st quarter of 2023. No one really knows for sure what will happen but it’s always good to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.  Throughout my 28-year career in recruitment I’ve seenmy fair share of tough economic circumstances. I was around when theeconomy collapsed after 9/11 and the US #unemployment rate rose from 4.2% to 5.7 percent. I was here when housing bubble popped in 2007 and 2008 which sent the US unemployment rate to 10.0% in October of 2009. And I was here when millions of workers lost their #jobs because of the Covid pandemic. In each of these cases no one ever really knew how bad things would get, or how long it would take for the economy to recover.  However, what we did know, was that tough times don’t last, tough people do, and when we focus on what we can control, we come out stronger and closer after they pass. That said, as well all prepare for these more uncertain times, let’s work together to help those that are less fortunate, especially as we head into this holiday season.  We all have something to give even if its only job search advice, a new connection, referrals, or hope. Small gestures go a long way and the number of people that need help right now seems to be growing by the week. Who wants to help?  If you are looking for help yourself, you can apply at www.astoncarter.com or we can put you in touch with one of our 1,500 specialized recruiting professionals across the US. NOVEMBER LAYOFFS #meta Laid off more than 11,000 employees, or 13% of its workforce.#twitter Laid off roughly 50% of its 7,500 employees#chrobinson is cutting up to 1,200 workers#salesforce is set to layoff up to 1,000 employees per TechCrunch #stripe is cutting 14% that could affect more than 1,000 employees#Redfin laid off 13% of its workforce – 862 people, according to CNN #Opendoor is laying off about 550 employees, 18% of its workforce #lyft is cutting 13% of it's workforce laying off approximately 700 more#Juul is laying off about 400 people#zendesk  has laid off about 350 employees, or 5% of its workforce.#Barclay's laid off about 200 employees in its banking and trading units#chime is laying off about 160 people #Sada laid off 11% of its workforce#hootsuite  Cut 5% of its staff, its second round of layoffs since August

In the same vein that work-life balance is diverse, it is probably natural that various companies, groups, and organizations are also diverse.However, as the term "bipolarization" simply expresses, economic flows are not diverse.I feel that the economy and society are moving in such a way that those areas where economic and social flows are abundant are valuable, and those areas where they are depleted are worthless.Once that is resolved, I don't think Twitter Inc. will be in that much trouble, no matter what kind of company it is or who Elon Musk is.The difference between a "boss" and a "leader" was once a topic of conversation, but as long as it is a group of "bosses" in various fields that are running the world as a whole, it may be difficult to discuss various issues with citizens while accepting each other and to solve them in a win-win situation for the whole.By the way, I do not judge whether Elon Musk is a "boss" or a "leader" based on this article alone.ワークライフバランスが多様であるのと同列で、様々な企業・団体・組織が多様であるのも当然だろうと思います。ただ、「二極化」という言葉が端的に表しているように、経済の流れが多様ではありません。さも、経済・社会の流れが潤沢であるところが価値があるものであり、枯渇しているところには価値がないものであるように、経済・社会が動いているように、私は感じます。そこが解決すれば、Twitter社がどんな会社でも、イーロン・マスクがどんな人でも、そこまで困ったことは起こらなくなると思うのです。かつて、「ボス」と「リーダー」の違いが話題になったことがありますが、世界全体を動かしているのが各分野の「ボス」集団であるうちは、様々な問題を、市民と受け入れて合いながら議論することも、全体がwin-winで解決することも、難しいのかもしれませんね。ちなみに、イーロン・マスクが「ボス」なのか「リーダー」なのかは、私はこの記事だけでは判断しません。#ダイバーシティ #インクルージョン #キャリア #雇用 #外国人労働者 #障がい #女性問題 #ハラスメント #教育 #イノベーション #グローバリゼーション #ローカリゼーション #人権 #哲学 #ビジネス #仕事 #人 #未来 #質 #生活の質 #経済 #幸せ #幸福感 #環境 #看護 #介護 #投資 #投資家#Diversity #Inclusion #Career #employment #unemployment #foreign_workers #disabilities #women #harassment #education #innovation #Globalization #Localization #Humanrights #human_rights #philosophy #SDGs #Let_us_act #business #work #people #future #quality #quality_of_life #money #happiness #environment #nursing #care_support #investment #investor #covid

On this day in Social Security Administration history and the global movement to provide social economic insurance: 11/19/1945 In a special message to Congress, President Truman proposed a comprehensive, prepaid medical insurance plan for all people through the Social Security system. The plan would have covered doctors, hospital, nursing, laboratory and dental services for people covered by the Social Security program; it would also have provided benefits financed from Federal Revenues for needy people. A revised Wagner-Murray-Dingell Bill providing for National Health Insurance was immediately introduced. More (from Arthur J. Altmeyer, Chairman, Social Security Board, At National Conference of Social Work Buffalo, New York, May 23, 1946): https://lnkd.in/gKUniHt6 Also, The Evolution of Medicare, Chapter 3: The Third Round 1943-1950, by Peter A. Corning, https://lnkd.in/gaEBa5z4 (Table of Contents: https://lnkd.in/efciGMab) 11/19/1995 In the fall of 1995, the nation experienced an unprecedented event. On this day, the four-day furlough in November 1995 that significantly impacted the Agency’s service to the public, ended. SSA’s contingency plan allowed for the retention of 4,780 employees, while the other 61,415 were placed in furlough status. The American public was unable to conduct its business with SSA, and the effect of the shutdown was felt immediately. Due to a budget deadlock in Congress, the Federal Government shutdown twice. This was the first and the second was from December 16, 1995, through January 5, 1996.

With our expanded post employment services, in addition to #unemploymentcostmanagement we now offer Reemployment Services that will help your employees get back to work sooner.

Recruiters and hiring managers sometimes fail to distinguish between firings and layoffs when perusing resumes, causing valuable candidates to slip through the cracks. With low unemployment the new norm, potential employers must be willing to dig deeper to understand exactly why an applicant left their previous job.

While companies may lay off employees to streamline processes or reorganize, that doesn’t mean those employees don’t have marketable skills that can be of value to a new employer. In fact, layoffs present a valuable opportunity for hiring entities as experienced candidates reenter the job market.

On this day in Social Security Administration history and the global movement to provide social economic insurance: 11/20/1964 Evaluation and Measurement System, designed to continuously assess the validity of the assumptions underlying claims policy, was established. More: https://lnkd.in/eAX2XPcc 11/20/1995 President Clinton held a press conference that afternoon and announced to the public that this shutdown was unacceptable, that Americans needed to be able to conduct business, and that SSA was recalling approximately 49,715 more employees in direct service positions back to work. The four-day furlough severely impacted SSA’s ability to provide the quality service that the American people expect. More: https://lnkd.in/eyvu29Kh and more context on the 1995 government shutdown drama C-SPAN November 17, 1995 Washington Journal https://lnkd.in/eRKQH7fK 11/20/2000 An important initiative in SSA’s disability process redesign effort had been the Disability Claim Manager (DCM). Under this model, a single individual had responsibility for all phases of the initial disability determination process, including development and decisions on both medical and non-medical components of eligibility. On this day the DCM test, which, by design, was being conducted in two phases over a three-year period, ended. Also, as part of its overall plan for managing the disability process, Commissioner Apfel directed in 1999 that the Agency develop a plan for improving the hearings process. In June 1999, SSA released the Hearings Process Improvement (HPI) initiative. Phase 2 implementation brought HPI to 52 additional hearing offices in October 2000, and the remaining 49 offices rolled out by this day.

How to apply for #unemployment benefits in #Ukraine: an algorithm of actions and new amountsRussian missile attacks on the critical infrastructure of Ukraine continue in an even more ferocious form. The shelling of the occupiers has a critical impact on business, which suffers due to widespread power outages. Businesses are forced to look for ways to stay afloat.

Initial Jobless Claims, which measures individuals filing for unemployment benefits for the first time, rose 2,000 to 219,000, but after a negative revision of 6,000 to last week.  Continuing Claims, or those that continue to receive benefits after their initial claim, rose 13,000 to 1.5M and has been significantly rising over the past few weeks.  The rise in continuing could mean it’s harder to find a job once let go.
